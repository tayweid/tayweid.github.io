## ECON 0150 | Final Case Study Project

### Project Guidelines

#### Overview

In this final project, you will demonstrate your ability to analyze real-world data using the tools and techniques learned throughout the semester. You will select a dataset, conduct a comprehensive analysis, and present your find- ings through both a slide presentation and a written report. Some reports will be chosen to be displayed on the course website after the semester has finished and used as references for future classes.

#### Learning Objectives

- Apply data analysis techniques using Python
- Demonstrate proficiency in exploratory data analysis and visualization
- Utilize statistical methods to draw meaningful conclusions
- Effectively communicate findings to a technical audience

#### Dataset Selection

Choose one of the following approaches

1. Select a dataset from a database (e.g., FRED, World Bank, BLS, Election Data Source, etc.).
2. Find your own dataset related to an economic question that interests you.
3. Combine multiple datasets to explore relationships between different economic variables.

#### Requirements

Your analysis must include:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Summary statistics
   - Data cleaning and preparation
   - At least two different types of visualizations 

2. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Probability distributions of key variables
   - Hypothesis testing relevant to your research question 
   - Regression analysis (if applicable to your research question)

3. **Insights** 
   - Clear connection between your analysis and economic concepts
   - Discussion of implications and limitations 
   - Suggestions for further research

#### Presentation (1-2 slides)

Create 1-2 clear, concise slides highlighting:

- Research question
- Key findings
- Most compelling visualization
- Main conclusions

Be prepared for a 3-minute presentation.

#### Written Report

Submit a short report (roughly 2 pages) including:

1. Introduction and motivation
2. Data description and sources 
3. Methodology
4. Results and analysis
5. Conclusions
6. References
7. Appendix with your code/spreadsheet formulas
