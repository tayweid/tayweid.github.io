## ECON 0150 | Final Project Ideas

This document includes six project ideas and a list of project ideas from previous students. 

### Proposal 1: The Relationship between Unemployment Benefits on Job Recovery Rates

**Research Question:** How are changes in unemployment benefits related to the rate of job recovery in the U.S.?

**Dataset:** Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on unemployment rates and recovery rates combined with state-level unemployment benefit policies from 2015–2023.

**Approach:**

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** 
   - Summary statistics for unemployment rates and benefit levels by state. 
   - Visualize trends in unemployment rates before and after benefit policy changes.

2. **Statistical Analysis:** 
   - Use hypothesis testing to determine if states with higher benefits experience different job recovery rates. 
   - Perform regression analysis to identify the impact of benefit levels on job recovery.

3. **Insights:** 
   - Discuss the potential trade-offs between providing financial security and incentivizing job-seeking behavior.

### Proposal 2: Gender Wage Gap Trends in Tech Industries

**Research Question:** What factors are related to the gender wage gap in the technology sector, and how has it evolved over time?

**Dataset:** Data from Glassdoor on salaries by gender in technology roles, combined with labor market statistics from the FRED database.

**Approach:**

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** 
   - Calculate summary statistics for median salaries by gender across tech roles. 
   - Create visualizations of wage trends over the past decade.

2. **Statistical Analysis:**

- Examine the distributions of wages for male and female employees.

- Test hypotheses related to differences in wages by role and seniority. 

3. **Insights:**

- Suggest potential policy recommendations to address the wage gap.
- Highlight limitations, such as the role of negotiation practices or job responsibilities.

### Proposal 3: The Effect of Minimum Wage Increases on Inflation

**Research Question:** Do state-level increases in the minimum wage contribute to higher inflation rates?

**Dataset:** State-level minimum wage data from the Department of Labor, paired with inflation data from the World Bank and regional price indices from the BLS.

**Approach:**

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**

   - Compare inflation rates in states with recent minimum wage increases to those without. 

   - Visualize correlations between wage changes and inflation trends.

2. **Statistical Analysis:**

   - Conduct hypothesis testing to identify significant differences in inflation rates.
   - Use regression to control for confounding factors such as population size and GDP growth.

3. **Insights:**

   - Discuss implications for policymakers, especially concerning balancing wage growth and economic stability.

### Proposal 4: Voter Turnout Analysis Across States

**Research Question:** What factors were most strongly correlated with voter turnout across states in the 2024 U.S. presi- dential election?

**Dataset:** State-level voter turnout data from the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) or other sources, combined with demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau.

**Approach:**

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Analyze turnout rates by state and demographic group.
   - Create visualizations to highlight turnout trends across regions.
2. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Use regression analysis to assess the relationship between factors such as income, education, and age and turnout.
   - Perform hypothesis testing to compare turnout rates in states with and without mail-in voting policies.
3. **Insights:**
   - Discuss the effectiveness of turnout strategies and potential barriers to voting.



### Proposal 5: Analysis of Vote Share by Party

**Research Question:** How did economic conditions influence vote shares for the two major parties in the 2024 election?

**Dataset:** County-level vote share data from the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and unemployment rates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

**Approach:**

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Compare vote shares in counties with different economic profiles.
   - Visualize the relationship between unemployment rates and party vote shares.
2. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Use correlation analysis to identify relationships between economic conditions and vote shares.
   - Test hypotheses about differences in voting patterns between urban and rural counties.
3. **Insights:**
   - Discuss the relationship between economic conditions and voter behavior.



### Proposal 6: Impact of Voting Methods on Election Outcomes

**Research Question:** Did the availability of early voting or mail-in ballots relate to the outcome of the 2024 presidential election?

**Dataset:** Data on voting methods and outcomes by state from the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), combined with demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau.

**Approach:**

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Analyze the share of votes cast via early voting, mail-in ballots, and in-person voting.
   - Visualize differences in voting methods by state and demographic group.
2. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Test hypotheses about the relationship between voting methods and party vote shares.
   - Perform a regression to assess the relationship between the availability of different methods and the election outcome.
3. **Insights:**
   - Discuss the implications of election policy and access to voting.
