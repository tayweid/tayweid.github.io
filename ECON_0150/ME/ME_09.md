## Housing Market Analysis

A researcher is investigating factors affecting residential property values across different metropolitan areas. The dataset contains the following variables:

- `price`: Housing price in thousands of dollars
- `sqft`: Property size in square feet
- `age`: Age of the property in years
- `bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms
- `distance`: Distance to city center in miles
- `quarter`: Quarter of observation (1-4)
- `urban`: Dummy variable (1 if property in urban area, 0 if suburban)

###### Q1. The researcher wants to examine whether the relationship between property size and price differs between urban and suburban areas. Which regression model would be most appropriate?

A) price = β₀ + β₁·sqft + β₂·urban + ε  
B) price = β₀ + β₁·sqft + β₂·urban + β₃·(sqft×urban) + ε  
C) price = β₀ + β₁·sqft + β₂·age + β₃·bedrooms + ε  
D) log(price) = β₀ + β₁·log(sqft) + β₂·urban + ε  

###### Q2. The researcher suspects that the effect of distance to city center on housing prices varies with property age. Which approach would best capture this relationship?

A) price = β₀ + β₁·distance + β₂·age + β₃·bedrooms + ε  
B) price = β₀ + β₁·distance + β₂·age + β₃·(distance×age) + ε  
C) price = β₀ + β₁·distance + β₂·age + β₃·bedrooms + β₄·(bedrooms×age) + ε  
D) price = β₀ + β₁·distance + β₂·log(age) + β₃·log(bedrooms) + ε  

###### Q3. The researcher observes that the relationship between property size and price appears non-linear, with each additional square foot contributing less to the price at larger house sizes. Which transformation would best capture this relationship?

A) Including sqft² as an additional predictor  
B) Using log(sqft) instead of sqft  
C) Creating dummy variables for property size quartiles  
D) Using first differences (Δsqft) instead of size levels  

###### Q4. The data shows significant heteroskedasticity when modeling housing prices across different metropolitan areas. Which approach would most effectively address this issue?

A) Using robust standard errors  
B) Modeling price changes (Δprice) rather than price levels  
C) Adding more property characteristic variables  
D) Using a log transformation of the dependent variable  

###### Q5. The researcher hypothesizes that the effect of number of bedrooms on housing prices varies by property size. Write the complete regression specification (using β coefficients) that would test this relationship.



###### Q6. The data shows clear quarterly patterns in housing prices throughout the year:

a) Write a regression model that would identify these seasonal patterns while controlling for property size and age.



b) How would you interpret the coefficient on the Quarter 2 dummy variable in this model?
