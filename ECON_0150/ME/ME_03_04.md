**a)** In one sentence, describe the overall pattern you observe.

**b)** If you wanted to make the relationship more linear, what transformation would you apply? Explain why in one sentence.




###### Q2. You have monthly unemployment data for three regions (North, South, Central) from 2020-2024, and you notice the following:
- The North region shows strong seasonal patterns
- The South region has an upward trend

###### Q3. You have a dataset about Chicago public parks with four variables: Park name and type (playground, sports field, nature area, etc.); Zipcode for each park; Zipcode centroid; Population of the park's zipcode. You have another dataset with coordinates of the Lake Michigan shoreline.
**a)** After creating a map, if you wanted to examine whether parks are more common in zipcodes closer to Lake Michigan, how would you process and visualize the data? Answer in one sentence.



**b)** What type of visualization would you use to see if certain types of parks (playground, sports field, etc.) tend to be more common at different distances from the lake? Answer in one sentence.

| Q4      | 20          | 4              |

**a)** What type of plot would you use to examine the relationship between marketing spend and revenue? Explain in one sentence.



**b)** Draw a rough sketch of this plot (to the right ->).





**c)** What pattern do you observe? Explain in one sentence.




###### Q5. You have annual temperature data for 50 cities, but the cities range from very small (population 50,000) to very large (population 15 million). You want to examine if larger cities tend to have higher temperatures.

**a)** What visualization would you use? Explain in one sentence.



**b)** Would you transform either variable? If so, explain why in one sentence.
