## Statistics
<p class="subheader"> Why not just use visuals?</p>

*> A picture is worth a thousand summary stats.*

. . .

*> But sometimes we want something more precise and concrete.*

<br>

. . . 

**Q.** What is the ‘middle’ age in the class?

- Measures of Location: **Mean, Median, Mode**

. . .

**Q.** How spread out are the ages in the class?

- Measures of Dispersion / Spread: **Variance, Standard Deviation, Range**

---

## Measure of Central Tendency (Location)
<p class="subheader"> What is the "center" of the data?</p>

. . .

**Mode**: *the value that appears most often*

. . .

<br>

**Median**: *the value separating the higher and lower halves*

. . .

- If there are an odd number of values, choose the middle-ranked value
- If there are an even number of values, take the mean of the middle two

. . .

**Mean**: the center of mass

. . .

$$\bar{x} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + ... x_N}{N}$$

## Measure of Dispersion
<p class="subheader"> How spread out is the data?</p>

## Measure of Dispersion
<p class="subheader"> How spread out is the data?</p>

**Range**: difference between the largest and smallest value in the data

. . .

- Simple but doesn't respond to changes near the middle of the distribution 

. . .

**Mean Deviation**: difference between each value and the average

$$ \sum \frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{n} = \frac{X - \bar{X}}{n}$$

. . .

- Simple but the average of the difference is zero...

. . .

**Mean Absolute Deviation**: absolute value of the difference from the average

$$ \sum \frac{|x_i - \bar{x}|}{n} = \frac{|X - \bar{X}|}{n}$$

. . .

- The mean isn't zero
- A little more complex and isn't so nice mathematically

---

## Measure of Dispersion
<p class="subheader"> How spread out is the data?</p>

**Variance**: average squared difference from the mean

$$ Var(X) = \sum \frac{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n}$$

. . .

- Treats negatives appropriately
- The mean isn't zero
- Mathematically nice
- Units are uninformative

---

## Measure of Dispersion
<p class="subheader"> How spread out is the data?</p>

**Standard Deviation**: a sort of average deviation from the mean

$$ \sigma_X = \sqrt{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2} = \sqrt{(X - \bar{X})^2 / n} $$

. . .

- Treats negatives appropriately
- The mean isn't zero
- Mathematically nice
- Units are roughly average deviation from the mean

---

## Random Variables
<p class="subheader"> What is data? ... some fancy definitions....</p>

**Random Variable**: *a function that assigns a number to each possible outcome of a random process*

<br><br><br>

. . .

*> just think of it like you're drawing a card from a shuffled deck*

. . .

*> which card you pull is random and depends on which cards are in the deck*


---

## Random Variables: Tennis Example
<p class="subheader"> What is data? ... some fancy definitions....</p>

**Random Variable**: *a function that assigns a number to each possible outcome of a random process (discrete or continuous)*

. . .

**Probability Mass/Density Function**: *a function that assigns probabilities to each possible outcome*

. . .

**Observation**: *a realization of a random variable*

. . .

**Sample**: *a collection of observations*

<br><br>

. . .

*> the random variable is the deck*

. . .

*> the observation is the card you drew*

. . .

*> the sample is the record of cards you've drawn*

. . .

*> are the ages in the survey a random variable or observations?*

## Some Known Distributions
<p class="subheader"> ... some well understood random variables</p>

![](../Examples/Part_3_1/i/distributions.png){fig-align="center"}

---

## Random Variables
<p class="subheader"> What is data?</p>

<br><br>

- Knowing the distribution, we can compute mean, standard deviation, etc.

. . .

- This makes it easy to answer questions about the population. 

---

## Random Variables: Rich Person Bet Example
<p class="subheader"> What is data?</p>

We'll toss a coin once:

- If it's heads, you get $10 million
- If it's tails, you pay $1 million

What are expected value (theoretical mean), variance, and standard deviation of the change in your wealth after this coin toss?

. . .

<br><br>

*> lets do it in two ways (theoretical and simulation) in the notebook!*

---

## Random Variables: Bus Times Example
<p class="subheader"> What is the distribution of bus arrival times?</p>

. . .

1. If I arrive at a random time, what's my expected wait time until the next bus?

. . .

2. What's the probability I'll have to wait more than 20 minutes?

. . .

3. What's the probability my wait will be between 5 and 15 minutes?

## Random Variables: Ages Example
<p class="subheader"> What is the distribution of ages in this class?</p>

<br><br>

- This makes it easy to answer questions about the population. 

. . .

- What is the distribution of ages in this class?
