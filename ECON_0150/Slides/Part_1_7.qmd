## Example 1.7 | Starbucks Location Hours
<p class="subheader-center">How many shops are open at once?</p>

. . .

<br>

```{.python code-line-numbers="2,5"}
# Import packages
import pandas as pd

# Load data
hours = pd.read_csv("Starbucks_Location_Hours.csv")
```

. . .

<br>

*>as is common, it's difficult to understand the raw data on its own*

---

## Location Hours
<p class="subheader-center">What times to shops open?</p>

. . .

```{.python code-line-numbers="2"}
# Histogram of opening times
plt.hist(hours.open)
```

. . .

![](../Examples/Part_1_7/i/1.png)

. . .

*> but does this tell us how many shops are open at one time?*

---

## Location Hours
<p class="subheader-center">What times do shops open (GMT)?</p>

. . .

```{.python code-line-numbers="2,5"}
# Normalize to GMT
hours['open_GMT'] = hours['open'] - hours['timezone']

# Histogram of opening times (GMT)
plt.hist(hours.open_GMT)
```

*> what do the negative values mean?*

---

## Location Hours
<p class="subheader-center">Normalize the negative values 24 hours.</p>

. . .

```{.python code-line-numbers="2,5"}
# Normalize to 24 hours
hours['open_GMT'] = hours['open_GMT'].mod(24)
```

. . .

## Location Hours
<p class="subheader-center">Closing times have the same issue.</p>

```{.python code-line-numbers="2,5"}
# Normalize to GMT
hours['close_GMT'] = hours['close'] - hours['timezone']

# Histogram of opening times (GMT)
plt.hist(hours.close_GMT)
```

![](../Examples/Part_1_7/i/4.png)

---

## Location Hours
<p class="subheader-center">Normalize the positive values to 24 hours.</p>

. . .

```{.python code-line-numbers="2"}
# Normalize to 24 hours
hours['close_GMT'] = hours['close_GMT'].mod(24)
```

## Location Hours
<p class="subheader-center">So, how many locations are open at each hour of the day? </p>

![](../Examples/Part_1_7/i/6.png)

. . .

*> this only tells us openings and closings at each hour, not total open*

. . .

*> instead, lets sum up all the shops that have opened <b>that day</b>*

---

## Location Hours
<p class="subheader-center">So, how many locations are open at each hour of the day? </p>

. . .

```{.python code-line-numbers="2|5"}
# Construct values by bin
opened_values = hours['open_GMT'].value_counts(bins=24, sort=False)

# Cumulative sum
total_opened = opened_values.cumsum()
```

## Location Hours
<p class="subheader-center">So, how many locations are open at each hour of the day? </p>

![](../Examples/Part_1_7/i/7.png)

*> from here, to find the total that have opened/closed, we take the difference*

---

## Location Hours
<p class="subheader-center">So, how many locations are open at each hour of the day? </p>

. . .

```{.python code-line-numbers="2"}
# Take the difference
net_increase = total_opened - total_closed
```

. . .

![](../Examples/Part_1_7/i/8.png)

. . .

*> why is the green line negative?*

. . .

*> lets add the number open at midnight (GMT).*

## Location Hours
<p class="subheader-center">So, how many locations are open at each hour of the day? </p>

. . .

```{.python code-line-numbers="2|3"}
# Add those open at midnight
count_open_after_close = len(hours[hours['open_GMT'] >= hours['close_GMT']])
cumulative_open = net_increase + count_open_after_close
```
