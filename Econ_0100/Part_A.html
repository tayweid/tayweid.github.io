        <p>
            Part A begins with a big question. What should we choose when we can't have everything? Even the richest people in the world can't have everything they might want. Our wants exceed our resources. So how should we as individuals and groups go about making choices? 
        </p>
        <p>
            When we view the cost of a choice as the value of our next best option, we can make everyone better off simultaneously. To show this, we'll build a model of opportunity cost, the production possibility frontier (PPF), and comparative advantage, asking: Where on the PPF should we live?
        </p>
        <p>
            This question is where economic thinking began and makes up many of the puzzles at the heart of how we organize society. And it's exactly where we're headed in this course.

            Start Part A by skimming the reading to develop an understanding of the scope of what's being discussed. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            Then once you've finished reading, take a look at the practice material, and use the text as a resource when you need help. This way, you know what's most important, get to practicing quickly, and know where to find help when you innevitably get stuck.

            Demo A is very similar to what you'll see on MiniExam A. This is a resource for you to use as you'd like. But here's my advice. Start by trying to solve Demo A on your own. Then once you've worked through everything as best you're able, use the video and solutions to check your work. You're more than welcome to watch this video first, but you're not going to catch your weak points as easily, which is the main point.

        <h1 class="subtitle">FAQs</h1>
        <p>
            Here’s your roundup of quality questions (anonymized and summarized) asked by your colleges. If you see your question here, take it as a compliment from me. :)
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Q. </b>How come the slope of the PPF is the negative of the opportunity cost of spinach? Why couldn't it be positive since the opportunity cost is positive after all? I do realize that the curve wouldn't concave down, hence it not being at PPF.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>A. </b>Right, when we think about costs (like the cost of a coffee) we give it a positive number (like $3.00). This is all we’re doing with opportunity cost. The slope of the PPF is negative since it reflects the trade off between the two goods. You could say buying a coffee gives you -$3.00 instead of costing you $3.00. The same idea applies to why opportunity costs here is positive.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Q. </b>The PPF shifts in a diagonal sort of way (y-intercept (0, 8) and x-intercept (45, 0) because the new technology was introduced only to increase the carrot production, correct? If there was technology to increase the spinach production, then the PPF would shift out more or less evenly. However, I would imagine the curve not being completely linear if the two different technologies increased the amount of each crop at a different rate. I wouldn't be certain on how to approach that instance. Ultimately, I want to make sure that the units of spinach also increase when the technology for carrots is used.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>A. </b>It’s right that the pivot of the PPF was just because the technology impacted one of the two crops. If, however, we introduced a second new technology improving spinach, we would still see a linear PPF, just with another pivot out on the other axis. The idea would be the same as with the carrot pivot, just doing it a second time for spinach. If the technology shift’s the PPF linearly, no matter how many technologies are introduced the PPF will always be linear. :)
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Q. </b>You mentioned in Lecture 1 that one can find the slope of the PPF. This is true because the frontier is linear, but what if the points make the shape of a curve? Would we then take the derivative? 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>A. </b>Yes. If the PPF isn’t linear then we can’t just easily use the slope to find the opportunity cost. But one could take a derivative to find the opportunity cost at a particular point. If its not linear, then the slope would then vary. But! You won’t need to do that in this class.
