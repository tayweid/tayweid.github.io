## Details

**Instructor:** Taylor Weidman

**Office Hours:** Wednesdays, 2:30pm to 4:30pm

- Normally I'll try to be in the MQE space for the first hour, especially if a homework is due!
- If I'm not there, or you wanted to set up an individual appointment, just email and we can figure out a slot in person in my office.

## Objectives

Applications of Economic Analysis Techniques moves beyond ordinary regression to look at more-specialized models and data that are important to economists. The course expands students' knowledge of econometric methods to account for qualitative and selected dependent variables via maximum likelihood, and presents more structured estimation models. Throughout, the focus is on building students' experience with more advanced techniques, both for estimation and inferences; their understanding of the pros and cons of these methods; and, importantly, how best to extract insights from them to aid in decision making.

## Logistics

The class will meet in person, and attendance is expected. The class meets in the MQE classroom. Announcements about any changes to this plan will be made via Canvas.

## Hardware and Software

Computer use during class is highly recommended. This class will use R via a Python environment. Each student should make sure they have those programs on their laptop. Installations of R (and RStudio) are assumed given the previous classes, however we will also install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) distribution of Python to use Jupyter, an interactive Python notebook environment that is commonly used by data scientists.
