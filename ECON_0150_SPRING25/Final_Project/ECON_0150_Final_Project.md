## ECON 0150 | Final Case Study Project

### Project Guidelines

#### Overview

In this final project, you will demonstrate your ability to analyze real-world data using the tools and techniques learned throughout the semester. You will select a dataset, conduct a comprehensive analysis, and present your find- ings through both a slide presentation and a written report. Some reports will be chosen to be displayed on the course website after the semester has finished and used as references for future classes.

#### Learning Objectives

- Parts 1 - 2: Demonstrate proficiency in exploratory data analysis and visualization
- Parts 3 - 5: Use statistical methods to draw meaningful conclusions
- Part 6: Effectively communicate findings to a intermediate-technical audience

#### Dataset Selection

Choose one of the following approaches

1. Select a dataset from a database (e.g., FRED, World Bank, BLS, Election Data Source, etc.).
2. Find your own dataset related to an economic question that interests you.
3. Combine multiple datasets to explore relationships between different economic variables.

#### Requirements

Your analysis must include:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Summary statistics
   - Data cleaning and preparation
   - Visualizations / summaries of relevant variables / relationships

2. **General Linear Model**
   - Statement of the statistical model
   - A summary of the model's results and assumptions
   - Interpretation of the model's results
   - Limitations of the model

3. **Insights** 
   - Clear connection between your analysis and social / economic concepts
   - Discussion of implications and limitations 

#### Presentation (1-2 slides)

Create 1-2 clear, concise slides highlighting:

- Research question
- Key findings
- Most compelling visualization
- Main conclusions

Be prepared for a 3-minute presentation.

#### Written Report (1-2 pages)

Submit a short report (roughly 2 pages) including:

1. Introduction and question
2. Data description and sources 
3. Methodology
4. Results and analysis
5. Conclusions
6. References
