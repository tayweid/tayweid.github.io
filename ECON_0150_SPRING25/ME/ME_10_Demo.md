###### Q1. You are consulting for a government agency studying educational outcomes. Rewrite the following vague question into a specific, actionable economic research question: "How do schools affect student success?" 



###### Q2. You have a dataset of quarterly GDP values (in billions) for 45 countries over 15 years. Which transformation would be most appropriate for each analytical goal:

a) To compare economic growth rates across countries of different sizes:

*A) Calculate year-over-year percentage changes  
B) Divide each country's GDP by its population  
C) Standardize values by subtracting the mean and dividing by standard deviation  
D) Calculate the natural logarithm and then take first differences*  

b) To compare GDP values over time while removing the effects of inflation:

*A) Subtract the mean GDP from each country's value*
*B) Convert nominal GDP values to real GDP using price deflators or CPI data*
*C) Divide each country's GDP by the current exchange rate
D) Calculate a centered moving average for each country*

###### Q3. You have a dataset containing unemployment rates (%), minimum wage levels ($), and industry composition (% manufacturing jobs) for 120 cities at two time points: 2020 and 2023. Which visualization would best show the relationship between changes in minimum wage and changes in unemployment between these years?

*A) Parallel coordinate plot showing trajectories for each city  
B) Scatter plot with change in minimum wage on x-axis and change in unemployment on y-axis  
C) Grouped bar chart comparing minimum wage and unemployment by year  
D) Dual-axis line chart with minimum wage and unemployment over time*  

###### Q4. You analyze commuting times in a city and find they follow a right-skewed distribution with mean μ = 35 minutes and standard deviation σ = 15 minutes. If you take 400 random samples each containing 100 commuters, which statement about the sampling distribution of means is correct?

*A) It will have a mean of 35 minutes and standard deviation of 15 minutes  
B) It will have a mean of 35 minutes and standard deviation of 1.5 minutes  
C) It will have a mean of 35 minutes and standard deviation of 0.75 minutes  
D) It will be right-skewed with the same shape as the original distribution*  

###### Q5. An economist runs a regression to study how education and experience affect hourly wages:

          OLS Regression Results                            
==============================================================================
                 coef    std err          t      P>|t|      [0.025      0.975]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Intercept      1.842      0.214      8.607      0.002       1.422       2.262
education      0.107      0.015      7.133      0.013       0.078       0.136
experience     0.053      0.010      5.300      0.027       0.033       0.073
==============================================================================
```

a) Based on the regression results, what percentage increase in hourly wages is associated with each additional year of education?

*A) 1.07%  
B) 10.7%  
C) 0.107%  
D) 11.3%*  

b) If the null hypothesis is that experience has no effect on wages, what is the interpretation of the p-value for experience?

*A) There is a 0% chance that experience has no effect on wages*
*B) If we were to repeat this study many times, we would expect to get a coefficient this large or larger in 2.7% of samples even if experience truly had no effect*
*C) The probability that the effect of experience is exactly zero is 2.7%*
*D) If experience truly had no effect on wages, the probability of observing an estimate at least as extreme as 0.053 by random chance is about 2.7%*
