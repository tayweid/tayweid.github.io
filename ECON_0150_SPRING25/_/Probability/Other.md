## First Basic Skills

The idea today is to start by introducing probability theory, doing some statistics, and showing an example of why we need to be careful when using the tools. 

The first example is with something simple. I'm going to ask 10 of you what time you woke up. Then I'll calculate how many minutes you've been awake, and we'll do some statistics with the data.

Measures of central tendency. Measures of dispersion. Measures of symmetry. 



### Understand the Data Generating Process

The example for being careful is the geometric mean. If I ask you what is the average interest rate given three years of interest rate numbers, we should be able to find how much a $100 investment will be after those three years. 

What might you think it is?

Let's work with some numbers in excel.
