### *Part 5.3 | Why Correlation Isn't Causation (and What We Can Do About It)*

---

## Today's Class

1. The correlation ‚â† causation problem
2. Drawing out causal relationships
3. Using statistical controls to solve problems

---

## The Classic Example

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
Ice cream sales and crime rates are correlated!

Does ice cream cause crime? üç¶

## Drawing Causal Relationships

### We can draw arrows to show what causes what:

Temperature ‚Üí Ice Cream Sales

Temperature ‚Üí People Outside

People Outside ‚Üí Crime Rates

---

## Three Common Problems

1. Common Causes
2. Reverse Causality
3. Selection Bias

Let's look at each one...

---

## Problem 1: Common Causes

### Example: Ice Cream and Crime

```
              ‚Üó Ice Cream Sales
Temperature
              ‚Üò Crime Rates
```

The correlation is explained by a common cause!

---

## Problem 2: Reverse Causality

### Example: Do police reduce crime?

```
More Crime ‚Üí More Police
```
vs
```
More Police ‚Üí Less Crime
```

Which way does the arrow go? ü§î

---

## Problem 3: Selection Bias

### Example: SAT Prep Courses

Students who take SAT prep courses often score worse than those who don't!

What's wrong with this comparison? 

---

## How Can We Fix These Problems?

1. Draw out the relationships
2. Identify the problem
3. Use statistical controls

---

## Statistical Controls: The Basics

### What does "controlling for" mean?

Like comparing apples to apples üçé

Example: Looking at ice cream sales and crime rates *on days with the same temperature*

---

## Let's Practice!

### Does education increase earnings?

1. Draw the relationships
2. What might confound this?
3. What should we control for?

---

## Key Takeaways

1. Correlation ‚â† causation (but now you know why!)
2. Drawing arrows helps us think clearly
3. Control for confounders, but be careful what you control for
