here's the approach using sample stats
this is the basic approach we must understand
but we can also just use code to do this for us
what does this number mean?

now what if we had two groups we wanted to test whether they were different?
how would we do this?
it turns out we can turn this into a problem that fits into our t-test
take the difference between the two samples and find how it's distributed
here i've taken repeated samples from two random variables
here the random variables are equal and it turns out the distribution of differences in sample means is centered on zero
what is the standard error?
well you can see it's larger than the original distribution
here's the math for how we find it
now since this is itself a random variable, it is subject to all the nice things we talked about in part 3
but just like with the single sample wait time example, we have a nice package that will do the work for us
what does this number mean?

ok now we're on the front porch of the big model we use in the field
you've seen the simplest form of it in a t-test
we're going to ask more challenging questions next time and think about ways of answering them
