## Exercise: Restaurants by Zipcode
<p class="subheader"> Are there fewer restaurants further from downtown Pittsburgh?</p>

Weâ€™re going to use a Census maps and openly available data on restaurant locations to answer this question.

- **Data:** `Census Shapefiles` and `Open Street Maps`

## Geographic Data
<p class="subheader"> Some types of relationships in space</p>

<br><br>

:::{.incremental}
- Geographic data is data organized on three axes (latitude, longitude, altitude)
- We typically only use latitude and longitude
- Geo data is often combined with other variables like population
- Two main types of geo data: points, shapes
- We sometimes observe points, but most data comes in groups

## Geographic Data
<p class="subheader"> Maps can also show points</p>

<br>

:::{.incremental}
- Points are nice but we typically can't use them raw
- Some point transformations: distances between points; group by area; etc
- We can also relate points to other variables (eg. zipcode population for each restaurant)

## Geographic Data Example: Nunn (2008)
<p class="subheader"> Did the historical trade of enslaved people impact modern economic development in Africa?</p>

. . .

**Method:** Uses historical data and the distance from major ports

. . .

**Findings:** Areas more disrupted by enslavement have lower GDP today, due to:

  - **Weakened institutions** (political fragmentation, mistrust).
  - **Disrupted societies** (population loss, economic stagnation).

. . .

**Implication:** Historical shocks can have persistent economic effects.

## Geographic Data
<p class="subheader"> Are there fewer restaurants further from downtown Pittsburgh?</p>

**Steps:**

. . .

- Measure points by zipcode area

. . .

- Measure distances between groups (take the centroid, etc)
