#### Q1. Transforming Marriage Rates

The following questions are based on **crude marriage rates** — numbers of marriages per one thousand inhabitants — in 1990 and 2019. Each row represents a different European country. 

a) Create a new column of absolute change in marriage rates from 1990 to 2019. The **absolute change** between two values is the result of subtracting the old value from the new value. Which country in this dataset has the largest absolute change between these years (*Hint: do not take an absolute value; positive is greater than negative.*)?



b) Create a new column of relative change in marriage rates from 1990 to 2019. The **relative change** between two values is the ratio resulting from dividing the absolute change by the old value. Which country in this dataset has the largest relative change between these years?
