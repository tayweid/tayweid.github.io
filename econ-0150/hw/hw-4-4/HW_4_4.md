### Due: Wednesday, March 19, 5PM

Homework is designed to both test your knowledge and challenge you to apply familiar concepts in new applications. Answer clearly and completely. You are welcomed and encouraged to work in groups so long as your work is your own. Use the provided datasets to answer the following questions. Then submit your figures and answers to Gradescope.



#### Q1. Social Media and Mental Health

A (fictional) economist studied the relationship between social media usage, mental health, and academic performance among college students. A regression using data from 150 students used `academic_score` as the outcome variable produced the following (fictional) results:

```
=====================================================================================
                          coef    std err          t      P>|t|      [0.025      0.975]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
const                  82.4516      2.631     31.338      0.000      77.256      87.647
social_media_hrs       -0.9237      0.192     -4.810      0.031      -1.303      -0.544
mental_health_score     0.6382      0.145      4.401      0.300       0.352       0.925
first_gen_student      -4.1265      1.754     -2.353      0.020      -7.592      -0.661
=====================================================================================
```

Where:

- `academic_score` is the student's overall GPA on a 0-100 scale
- `social_media_hrs` is the average daily hours spent on social media
- `mental_health_score` is a validated mental wellness score (0-50, higher is better)
- `first_gen_student` is a binary indicator (1 if first-generation college student, 0 otherwise)

a) Interpret the coefficient on `social_media_hrs`. How is academic performance associated with each additional hour spent on social media?



b) Use one sentence to interpret the p-value on `social_media_hrs`.



c) Use one sentence to interpret the coefficient on `mental_health_score`. What does the coefficient tell us about the relationship between mental health and academic performance?



d) Use one sentence to interpret the p-value on `mental_health_score`.
