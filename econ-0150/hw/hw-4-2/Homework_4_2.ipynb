    "##### a)\n\nRead the article: Zhang, Q., Lamichhane, R., & Wang, Y. (2014). Associations between US adult obesity and state and county economic conditions in the recession. Journal of clinical medicine, 3(1), 153-166.\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4449673/\n\nBased on your reading, answer the following questions:\n\n1. What is the primary research question the authors are trying to answer?\n2. What dataset(s) do the authors use for their analysis? Be specific about the years and key variables.\n3. What are the main outcome variables, and what are the key explanatory variables?\n4. Summarize the main findings in 2\u20133 sentences. What is the estimated effect of county unemployment on BMI and physical activity? Is it statistically significant?\n\n##### b)\n\nYou are provided with a sample of individual-level data from the 2011 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), which includes the following variables:\n\n- `bmi` \u2013 individual Body Mass Index (kg/m\u00b2)\n- `Mental Healt` \u2013 days of Poor Mental Health in the Past 30 Days\n- `county_unemp` \u2013 county-level unemployment rate (in percentage points)\n\nUsing this data, estimate the following linear regression model:\n\n$$\n\\texttt{bmi}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\texttt{county\\_unemp}_i + \\varepsilon_i\n$$\n\n1. Report the estimated coefficients $\\hat\\beta_0$ and $\\hat\\beta_1$, along with their standard errors, $t$-statistics, and $p$-values. Also attach the code you run. \n    \n2. Interpret the coefficient $\\hat\\beta_1$. What does it suggest about the relationship between county unemployment and individual BMI?\n\n3. Identify the corresponding table and column in the Chen et al. (2014) paper where a similar regression is reported. How does your estimated coefficient compare in magnitude, sign, and statistical significance?\n\n##### c)\n\nThe 2011 BRFSS also includes information on mental health. The variable `menthlth` records the number of days in the past 30 days when the respondent's mental health was \"not good.\"\n\n1. Estimate the following regression model:\n   $$\n   \\texttt{menthlth}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\texttt{county\\_unemp}_i + \\varepsilon_i\n   $$\n   Report and interpret the estimated coefficient $\\hat\\beta_1$."
