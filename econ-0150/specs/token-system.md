# Token System

## Overview

Tokens are a limited currency that gives you flexibility in the course. You start with a fixed supply and can earn more through attendance. Tokens are spent on revisions, late submissions, and tier upgrades.

## Starting Tokens

Every student begins the semester with **4 tokens**.

## Spending Tokens

| Action | Cost | Details |
|--------|------|---------|
| **Revision attempt** | 1 token | Revise an assessment graded "not yet." Must be completed within 7 days of receiving the grade. |
| **Late HW submission** | 1 token | Submit homework up to 48 hours after the deadline. Must notify instructor before the original deadline. |
| **Tier upgrade attempt** | 2 tokens | Attempt the Advanced tier question on an assessment you already passed at Standard. |

## Earning Tokens

| Action | Tokens Earned | Details |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| **Perfect attendance through a Part** | 1 token | Attend every class session from the first day of a Part through the last day (including the MiniExam day). |

Maximum earnable tokens through attendance: **5** (one per Part).

## Revision Rules

### Homework Revisions
- You revise your original submission.
- Fix the questions that did not pass and resubmit.
- The revised submission is graded against the same specs.
- One revision per homework, maximum.

### MiniExam Revisions
- You take a **new version** of the MiniExam (different data, same format and question types).
- Revisions are completed during **office hours** by arrangement with the instructor.
- The new version is graded against the same specs as the original.
- One revision per MiniExam, maximum.

### Tier Upgrade Attempts
- Available only after you have passed Standard on the assessment.
- For MiniExams: you complete the Advanced question during office hours.
- For Homework: you complete the Advanced question and submit it.
- If you do not pass the Advanced tier, the Standard pass is unaffected.

## Constraints

- **One revision per assessment.** You cannot revise the same ME or HW twice.
- **7-day revision window.** Revisions must be completed within 7 calendar days of receiving your grade. Plan accordingly.
- **48-hour late window.** Late submissions beyond 48 hours are not accepted regardless of tokens.
- **Tokens cannot be traded, gifted, or borrowed.**
- **Unused tokens have no value at the end of the semester.** There is no bonus for leftover tokens.

## Strategy Notes

- With 4 starting tokens and up to 5 earnable, a student with perfect attendance could have up to 9 tokens over the semester.
- A typical revision path: receive "not yet" on ME 1, spend 1 token, retake during office hours within 7 days.
- Saving tokens for later in the semester is a reasonable strategy, since later material is more challenging.
- Spending 2 tokens on a tier upgrade is a significant investment. Only do this if you are confident in your ability and need the Advanced credit for your target grade.
