# Bundle 1: Data Identification & Univariate Visualization

## Part Coverage

This bundle corresponds to **Part 1** of the course.

## Core Competencies

A student who passes Bundle 1 can:

1. **Identify data structure**: Correctly classify a dataset as cross-sectional, time series, or panel.
2. **Classify variable types**: Distinguish among binary categorical, nominal categorical, ordinal categorical, discrete numerical, and continuous numerical variables.
3. **Count variables**: Identify how many variables a dataset contains (distinguishing variables from index/ID columns).
4. **Choose appropriate visualizations**: Select a chart type that matches the variable type(s) being displayed.
5. **Produce visualizations**: Create a properly labeled chart (axes, title, appropriate type) from data.

## Assessments

| Assessment | Standard Specs | Advanced Specs |
|------------|---------------|----------------|
| MiniExam 1 | `me-1-specs.md` | `me-1-specs.md` |
| Homework 1.1 | `hw-1-1-specs.md` | `hw-1-1-specs.md` |

## Passing the Bundle

- **Standard**: Pass Standard on ME 1 **and** Pass Standard on HW 1.1.
- **Advanced**: Pass Advanced on ME 1 **and** Pass Advanced on HW 1.1 (in addition to Standard).

## Key Concepts Students Must Know

### Data Structures
- **Cross-sectional**: Multiple subjects observed at one point in time.
- **Time series**: One subject observed across multiple time points.
- **Panel**: Multiple subjects observed across multiple time points.

### Variable Types
- **Binary categorical**: Exactly two categories (Yes/No, Approved/Denied).
- **Nominal categorical**: Categories with no inherent order (colors, majors, cities).
- **Ordinal categorical**: Categories with a meaningful order (satisfaction levels, education levels).
- **Discrete numerical**: Countable numbers (number of children, number of rooms).
- **Continuous numerical**: Measurable numbers on a continuum (income, temperature, square footage).

### Visualization Selection
| Variable Type(s) | Appropriate Charts |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Single categorical | Bar chart, pie chart |
| Single numerical | Histogram, boxplot |
| Time series (numerical over time) | Line chart |
| Two numerical | Scatter plot |
| Categorical + numerical | Grouped bar chart, side-by-side boxplots |

## Standard vs. Advanced: What Changes

**Standard** asks: "Given this dataset, what is the structure, what are the variable types, and what chart should you draw?"

**Advanced** asks: "Given a real-world question and a dataset with multiple variables, which variables matter, what visualization would you create, what would you look for in it, and what can't this data tell you?"

The shift is from executing a prescribed procedure to making and justifying analytical choices.
