# ECON 0150 | Spring 2026 | Grading System

## How Grading Works in This Course

This course uses **specifications grading**. Instead of accumulating points, you demonstrate competency on each Part of the course by meeting clearly published standards on the MiniExam and Homework.

### The Basics

- Every assessment is graded **Pass / Not Yet**.
- "Pass" means you met the published standard. "Not Yet" means you have not met it *yet* -- you can revise and try again.
- There is no partial credit. The standards are published in advance so you know exactly what is expected.

### Bundles

The course has **5 competency bundles**, one per Part:

| Bundle | Topic | You demonstrate competency by passing... |
|--------|-------|------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Data Identification & Visualization | ME 1 + HW 1.1 |
| 2 | Relationships & Data Operations | ME 2 + HW 2 |
| 3 | Statistical Inference | ME 3 + HW 3 |
| 4 | Bivariate Regression | ME 4 + HW 4 |
| 5 | Multivariate Regression | ME 5 + HW 5 |

You pass a bundle by passing **both** assessments for that Part.

### Two Levels: Standard and Advanced

Each assessment has two tiers:

- **Standard**: Can you execute the procedure correctly? These are the existing questions -- classify data, produce visualizations, run analyses.
- **Advanced**: Can you think like an analyst? These are additional open-ended questions where you choose what to analyze, interpret findings, and identify limitations.

You are not required to attempt Advanced. Standard is sufficient for a B.

### Your Grade

| Grade | What You Need |
|-------|---------------|
| **A** | Standard on all 5 bundles + Advanced on 4+ + Advanced Final Project |
| **A-** | Standard on all 5 bundles + Advanced on 3 + Advanced Final Project |
| **B+** | Standard on all 5 bundles + Advanced on 2 + Standard Final Project |
| **B** | Standard on all 5 bundles + Standard Final Project |
| **B-** | Standard on 4 bundles + Standard Final Project |
| **C+** | Standard on 4 bundles |
| **C** | Standard on 3 bundles |
| **D** | Standard on 2 bundles |
| **F** | Fewer than 2 bundles |

### Tokens

You start with **4 tokens**. You can earn more through perfect attendance (1 token per Part, up to 5 additional).

Tokens let you:
- **Revise** an assessment graded "Not Yet" (1 token, must complete within 7 days)
- **Submit homework late** (1 token, up to 48 hours)
- **Attempt an Advanced tier upgrade** on an assessment you already passed at Standard (2 tokens)

Rules:
- One revision per assessment, maximum.
- MiniExam revisions use a new version (different data, same format) taken during office hours.
- Homework revisions are corrections to your original submission.

### What This Means for You

1. **You know exactly what is expected.** Specs are published before every assessment.
2. **"Not Yet" is not failure.** It means you need more practice, and the revision system gives you that chance.
3. **Your grade reflects what you can do.** Every student who earns a given grade has demonstrated the same competencies.
4. **You have real choices.** You decide whether to pursue Advanced tiers based on your goals.
5. **Effort is rewarded.** Attendance earns tokens. Using tokens to revise earns passes. The system favors persistence.

### Questions?

If anything about this system is unclear, ask. The goal is transparency -- you should never be surprised by how grading works.
