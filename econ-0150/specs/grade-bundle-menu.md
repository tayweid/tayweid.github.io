# Grade Bundle Menu

## How Grades Are Determined

Your course grade is based on two things:

1. **How many of the 5 competency bundles you pass at Standard**
2. **How many you also pass at Advanced** (plus Final Project tier)

A bundle is passed at Standard when you pass Standard on **both** the MiniExam and Homework for that Part. Advanced requires passing Advanced on **both** as well.

## Grade Table

| Grade | Bundles at Standard | Bundles at Advanced | Final Project |
|-------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| **A** | 5 of 5 | 4 or more | Advanced |
| **A-** | 5 of 5 | 3 | Advanced |
| **B+** | 5 of 5 | 2 | Standard |
| **B** | 5 of 5 | 0-1 | Standard |
| **B-** | 4 of 5 | -- | Standard |
| **C+** | 4 of 5 | -- | -- |
| **C** | 3 of 5 | -- | -- |
| **D** | 2 of 5 | -- | -- |
| **F** | 0-1 | -- | -- |

"--" means this component is not required for that grade.

## Reading the Table

- **Each row is strictly harder than the row below it.** An A requires everything a B+ requires, plus more Advanced bundles and an Advanced final project.
- **Standard bundles are the foundation.** You cannot earn above a B without passing all 5 at Standard.
- **Advanced bundles differentiate within the A/B+ range.** They reward deeper analytical thinking.
- **The Final Project has its own Standard/Advanced tier.** It counts separately from the bundles.

## Examples

**Student who passes Standard on all 5 bundles, Advanced on Bundles 1 and 3, and submits a Standard final project:** B+ (5 Standard, 2 Advanced, Standard project).

**Student who passes Standard on Bundles 1-4, Advanced on Bundles 1-3, but does not pass Bundle 5:** B- (only 4 Standard bundles; Advanced count doesn't help without all 5 Standard).

**Student who passes Standard on all 5, Advanced on all 5, and submits an Advanced final project:** A.

## Final Project Tiers

The Final Project is evaluated separately from the bundles:

- **Standard**: Project demonstrates competent application of course methods to a real dataset. Analysis is correct and clearly presented.
- **Advanced**: Project demonstrates independent analytical thinking. Student makes and justifies their own methodological choices, interprets findings with nuance, and acknowledges limitations substantively.

Final Project specs will be published separately when the project is assigned.

## Important Notes

- Bundles are independent. Failing one does not affect the others.
- Advanced tier is cumulative with Standard. You must pass Standard to attempt Advanced credit.
- The grade menu is fixed for the semester. It will not be adjusted.
