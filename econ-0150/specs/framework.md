# ECON 0150 Specs Grading Framework

## Philosophy

This course uses **specifications grading** (specs grading), a system where each assessment is graded pass/not-yet against clearly stated criteria rather than scored on a points scale. The goal is to shift focus from "how many points can I get?" to "can I demonstrate this competency?"

Every student who passes an assessment has met the same standard. Grades are determined by *how many competencies you demonstrate* and *at what depth*, not by accumulating partial credit.

## How It Works

### Competency Bundles

The course is organized into **5 competency bundles**, one per Part. Each bundle represents a set of related skills that build on each other:

| Bundle | Name | Part | MiniExam | Core Skills |
|--------|------|------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Data Identification & Univariate Viz | 1 | ME 1 | Classify variables and data structures; choose and produce univariate visualizations |
| 2 | Relationships & Data Operations | 2 | ME 2 | Bivariate visualization; filter, group, and reshape data; interpret relationships |
| 3 | Statistical Inference | 3 | ME 3 | Sampling distributions, CLT, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing |
| 4 | Bivariate Regression | 4 | ME 4 | Specify and interpret regression with one predictor; residual diagnostics |
| 5 | Multivariate Regression | 5 | ME 5 | Multiple predictors, controls, interactions, model justification |

A bundle is **passed** by demonstrating competency on **both** the MiniExam and Homework for that Part. Passing one but not the other does not pass the bundle.

### Two Tiers of Competency

Each bundle can be demonstrated at two levels:

**Standard** -- "Can you execute the procedure correctly?"

- Tasks are fully specified: here is the data, here is what to do.
- Graded on correctness of classification, execution, and basic output interpretation.
- This corresponds approximately to the current assessment level.

**Advanced** -- "Can you think like an analyst?"

- Tasks are open-ended: here is a dataset and a question -- figure out what matters.
- Graded on the quality of analytical choices, depth of interpretation, and acknowledgment of limitations.
- This is the ceiling that creates meaningful grade separation.

A student passes a bundle at Standard by passing Standard on **both** the ME and HW. A student passes at Advanced by passing Advanced on **both** as well (in addition to Standard).

### Grade Determination

Your course grade is determined by how many bundles you pass and at what tier. See `grade-bundle-menu.md` for the full table.

### Revisions

Assessments graded "not yet" can be revised using **tokens**. See `token-system.md` for rules. The key idea: not-yet is not failure, it is "try again." The system is designed so that students who keep working eventually demonstrate what they know.

## Assessment Flow

For each Part of the course:

1. Content is taught through lectures, examples, and practice.
2. Students complete the **Homework** (take-home, open-resource) and submit by the deadline.
3. Students take the **MiniExam** (in-class, closed-resource, 20 minutes).
4. Both are graded pass/not-yet against published specs.
5. Students who receive not-yet may revise using tokens.
6. Once both are passed, the bundle is complete at that tier.

## What "Pass" Means

Pass criteria are published in advance for every assessment. They specify:

- What each question requires for a passing answer
- What counts as a minor error vs. a major error
- How many questions must pass for the assessment to pass
- What the Advanced tier question asks and how it is evaluated

There is no partial credit, no curve, and no ambiguity. Students know exactly what is expected before they begin.

## Design Principles

1. **Transparency**: All specs are published before the assessment.
2. **Mastery over speed**: Revisions are built into the system.
3. **Clear standards**: Every student who passes has met the same bar.
4. **Meaningful grades**: Each letter grade maps to a distinct set of demonstrated competencies.
5. **Growth-oriented**: "Not yet" is temporary. Tokens and revisions keep the path open.
