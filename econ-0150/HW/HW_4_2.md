Homework is designed to both test your knowledge and challenge you to apply familiar concepts in new applications. Answer clearly and completely. You are welcomed and encouraged to work in groups so long as your work is your own. Use the provided datasets to answer the following questions. Then submit your figures and answers to Gradescope.



#### Q1. Working Hours and Weekly Income

An economist is studying the relationship between time spent working (hours per week) and weekly income (in dollars) for part-time employees. The data for 15 randomly selected employees is:

```python
hours_worked = [15, 22, 12, 25, 18, 10, 20, 28, 14, 16, 24, 19, 21, 17, 23]
weekly_income = [320, 465, 255, 510, 385, 210, 420, 570, 305, 340, 
                 490, 400, 445, 360, 475]
```

a) Create a scatter plot of weekly income versus hours worked. Does there appear to be a relationship?





b) Fit a linear regression model to predict weekly income based on hours worked. What is the interpretation of the intercept coefficient?





c) What is the interpretation of the slope coefficient? 





d) What is the interpretation of the p-value of the slope coefficient?
