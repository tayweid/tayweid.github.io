## ECON 0150 | Fall 2025 | Homework 3.3

Homework is designed to both test your knowledge and challenge you to apply familiar concepts in new applications. Answer clearly and completely. You are welcomed and encouraged to work in groups so long as your work is your own. Submit your figures and answers to Gradescope.



### Context

A university runs a campus wellness program designed to reduce student anxiety. Anxiety is measured on a 0–21 scale (similar to the GAD-7) for the same students before and after the program. For each student, we compute the paired difference:

$$d_i = \text{after}_i - \text{before}_i$$

A negative $d_i$ means the student's anxiety decreased. We want to know: did the program work?

For the simulation questions below, assume the population of paired differences has mean $\mu_d = -3$ and standard deviation $\sigma_d = 5$.

#### Q1. Confidence Intervals with Known $\sigma$

Suppose we know $\sigma_d = 5$ and we sample $n = 25$ students.



a) Compute the standard error of $\bar{d}$. Then compute the probability that $\bar{d}$ falls within 1 SE of $\mu_d$, and within 1.96 SE of $\mu_d$. Use `stats.norm.cdf()`.



b) Construct a 95% confidence interval centered on $\mu_d$. Then simulate 1,000 samples of size $n = 25$ from this population. For each sample, compute $\bar{d}$. What fraction of the 1,000 sample means fall inside the confidence interval?



c) Now flip the perspective. For each of your 1,000 simulated samples, construct a 95% confidence interval centered on $\bar{d}$ (not on $\mu_d$). What fraction of these intervals contain the true $\mu_d$?



d) Compare your answers from (b) and (c). Why are these the same?

#### Q2. The t-Distribution

In practice we don't know $\sigma_d$. We estimate it with the sample standard deviation $S$. This introduces extra uncertainty. Use $n = 15$ for this question (a smaller sample makes the difference more visible).



a) Simulate 1,000 samples of size $n = 15$ from the same population ($\mu_d = -3$, $\sigma_d = 5$). For each sample, compute $\bar{d}$ and $S$. Construct a 90% confidence interval using the **normal distribution**: $\bar{d} \pm 1.645 \cdot S / \sqrt{n}$. Count how many of the 1,000 intervals contain $\mu_d$.

```
z_crit = stats.norm.ppf(0.95)
```



b) Repeat part (a), but now use the **t-distribution** critical value with $df = n - 1 = 14$: $\bar{d} \pm t_{crit} \cdot S / \sqrt{n}$. Count how many of the 1,000 intervals contain $\mu_d$.

```
t_crit = stats.t.ppf(0.95, df=14)
```



c) Which method is closer to the target coverage of 90%? In your own words, why does using the normal distribution with $S$ produce intervals that are too narrow?

#### Q3. Hypothesis Testing

Now let's test whether the wellness program actually works.



a) A university runs the program on $n = 25$ students and finds $\bar{d} = -2.8$ and $S = 4.6$. State the null and alternative hypotheses for testing whether the program has any effect on anxiety.



b) Compute the t-statistic and the two-sided p-value.

```
t_stat = (d_bar - 0) / (S / np.sqrt(n))
p_value = 2 * stats.t.sf(abs(t_stat), df=n-1)
```



c) At a significance level of $\alpha = 0.05$, do you reject $H_0$? Interpret your conclusion in the context of the wellness program.



d) A large national study of a similar program surveys $n = 2,000$ students and finds $\bar{d} = -0.3$ and $S = 5$. Compute the t-statistic and p-value. Is this result statistically significant at $\alpha = 0.05$?



e) A clinician considers a drop of at least 2 points on the anxiety scale to be meaningful. The first study found a 2.8-point drop. The second found a 0.3-point drop. Which result is *practically* significant? What does this tell you about the difference between statistical significance and practical significance?



---

#### Q4. Interpreting p-Values

A researcher studying the effect of a new teaching method on exam scores conducts a hypothesis test and reports a p-value of 0.032.



a) In your own words, what does this p-value tell us?



b) If the researcher used a significance level of $\alpha = 0.05$, would they reject the null hypothesis? What if they used $\alpha = 0.01$?



c) For each of the following statements, say whether it is **true or false** and explain your reasoning.

1. A p-value of 0.10 means there is a 10% chance that the null hypothesis is true.
2. If we fail to reject the null hypothesis, we have proven that it is true.
3. A small p-value indicates that our observed result would be unlikely if the null hypothesis were true.
