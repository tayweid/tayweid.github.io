##### Q1. US City Temperature

Using the provided dataset of US cities that includes:

- City name: `city`
- Population: `population`
- Latitude/longitude coordinates: `lat` and `lng`
- Average temperature: `avg_temp`
- Timezone: `timezone`

a) Create a map of the US cities in the dataset using a scatterplot. *(hint: use `lng` as the x value and `lat` as the y value.)*



b) Label each city with a different color by timezone. *(hint: use `timezone` as hue.)*



c) Plot US cities with size representing population and color representing average temperature. *(hint: use `size=population`, with `sizes=(1,200)`, and `hue=avg_temp`.)*



d) Use a scatterplot to visualize whether cities in the 'America/New_York' timezone have lower temperatures at higher latitudes. How would you describe this relationship between latitutde and average city temperature for east coast cities?
