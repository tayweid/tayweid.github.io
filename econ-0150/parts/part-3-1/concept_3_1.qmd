## ECON 0150 | Economic Data Analysis {.center}
<p class="subheader-center">The economist's data analysis skillset.</p>

<br> 

### *Part 3.1 | Data vs the Population*

---

## Inferences From Data
<p class="subheader">What can we infer about those not in our data?</p>

<br><br>

- We've **summarized** data
- But often we want to say something about the **population**, not just our **data**

---

## Data Question 1: Sleep Time in Two Samples
<p class="subheader">Which sample sleeps longer?</p>

![](i/c_01.png)

. . .

*> everyone in Group A sleeps longer than anyone in Group B*

---

## Data Question 2: Sleep Time in Two Samples
<p class="subheader">Which sample sleeps longer?</p>

![](i/c_02.png)

. . .

*> these distributions overlap... lets compare them more precisely*

---

## Measures of Location
<p class="subheader">Where is the "center" of each sample group?</p>

<br>

**Sample (Data) Mean**: The average value
$$\bar{x} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + ... x_N}{N}$$

---

## Measures of Location
<p class="subheader">Where is the "center" of each sample group?</p>

<br>

**Sample (Data) Mean**: The average value
$$\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$$

. . .

```{.python}
# Calculate means
mean_A = group_A.mean()
mean_B = group_B.mean()
```

. . .

```{python}
# Generate sleep data for two groups
import numpy as np
group_A = np.random.normal(7.2, 1.5, 50)  # Higher mean, higher variance
group_B = np.random.normal(6.8, 0.8, 50)  # Lower mean, lower variance

# Calculate means
mean_A = group_A.mean()
mean_B = group_B.mean()

print(f"Group A mean: {mean_A:.2f} hours")
print(f"Group B mean: {mean_B:.2f} hours")
```

---

## Data Question 2: Sleep Time in Two Samples
<p class="subheader">Which sample group sleeps longer?</p>

![](i/c_03.png)


```{python}
print(f"Sample Group A mean: {mean_A:.2f} hours")
print(f"Sample Group B mean: {mean_B:.2f} hours")
```

. . .

*> Group A sleeps longer **on average*** in our sample

. . .

*> but some in Sample Group B sleep longer than most in Sample Group A!*

---

## Measures of Dispersion
<p class="subheader"> How spread out is the data?</p>

<br>

**Range**: difference between the largest and smallest value in the data

. . .

- Simple but doesn't respond to changes near the middle of the distribution 


---

## Measures of Dispersion
<p class="subheader"> How spread out is the data?</p>

<br>

**Mean Deviation**: difference between each value and the average

$$ \sum \frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{n}$$

. . .

- Simple but the average of the difference is zero...

---

## Measures of Dispersion
<p class="subheader"> How spread out is the data?</p>

<br>

**Mean Absolute Deviation**: absolute value of the difference from the average

$$ \sum \frac{|x_i - \bar{x}|}{n}$$

. . .

- The mean isn't zero
- A little more complex and isn't so nice mathematically

---

## Measures of Dispersion
<p class="subheader"> How spread out is the data?</p>

<br>

**Variance**: average squared difference from the mean

$$ Var_X = \sum \frac{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n}$$

. . .

- Treats negatives appropriately
- The mean isn't zero
- Mathematically nice
- Units are uninformative

---

## Measures of Dispersion
<p class="subheader">How spread out is the data?</p>

<br>

**Standard Deviation**: A measure of spread
$$\begin{align}S_X = \sqrt{\sum \frac{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n}}\end{align}$$

. . .

- Treats negatives appropriately
- The mean isn't zero
- Mathematically nice
- Units are roughly average deviation from the mean

---

## Measures of Dispersion
<p class="subheader">How spread out is the data?</p>

<br>

**Standard Deviation**: A measure of spread
$$S_X = \sqrt{\sum \frac{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n}}$$

```{python}
#| echo: true
# Calculate standard deviations
std_A = group_A.std()
std_B = group_B.std()
```

. . .

```{python}
print(f"Group A std dev: {std_A:.2f} hours")
print(f"Group B std dev: {std_B:.2f} hours")
```

. . .

*> Group A has **more variability** - some sleep much less, some much more*

---

## Sample vs Population
<p class="subheader">Both sample groups are 50 people selected from two different counties.</p>

![](i/c_03.png)

. . .

Old question: "Which **sample group** sleeps longer?" *(about the **data**)*

. . .

New question: "Which **county** sleeps longer?" *(about the **population**)*

---

## Sample vs Population
<p class="subheader">The data is a sample drawn from a population.</p>

![](i/sample.png)

. . .

$\mu$ - population mean

$\sigma$ - population standard deviation

---

## Sample vs Population
<p class="subheader">We observe **samples**. We study **populations**.</p>

<br>

:::{.incremental}
- **Data**: 50 individuals we happened to sample from both counties
- **Population**: All people who could live in these counties
    - Even if we surveyed everyone today, tomorrow would bring new residents
    - The population is a theoretical concept - an infinite pool of possibilities
:::

<br><br>

. . .

***Fundamental Tension**: we observe data, which is drawn from a population, but is not the population itself, which is the object of our study.*

---

## Sample vs Population
<p class="subheader"> What is data? A sample.</p>

**Random Variable**: a random process about a population

. . .

- the random variable is like a deck of cards

. . .

**Probability (Mass/Density) Function**: a function that assigns probabilities to each possible outcome

. . .

- the probability function is like which cards are in the deck

. . .

**Observation**: a realization of a random variable
. . .

- the observation is the card you drew

. . .

**Sample**: a collection of observations

. . .

- the sample is the record of cards you've drawn

---

## Data is a Sample
<p class="subheader">A random variable generates our data.</p>

**Random Variable**: a random process about a population

**Probability Function**: a function that assigns probabilities to each possibility

. . .

![](i/c_04.png)

. . .

*> **data** is a **sample** drawn from a **random variable***

## Probability Functions
<p class="subheader">Random variables can have many kinds of probability functions.</p>

1. **$f(x) \geq 0$**: probabilities are never negative.
2. **$\int f(x)\,dx = 1$**: total probability sums to one.

## Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
<p class="subheader">The area under $f(x)$ up to each value — $F(x) = P(X \leq x)$.</p>

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy import stats
import seaborn as sns

x = np.linspace(2, 13, 1000)
y = stats.norm.pdf(x, 7.2, 1.5)

plt.figure(figsize=(9, 2.5))
plt.plot(x, y, 'b-', linewidth=2)
x_pt = 6.0
x_fill = x[x <= x_pt]
y_fill = stats.norm.pdf(x_fill, 7.2, 1.5)
plt.fill_between(x_fill, y_fill, alpha=0.3, color='red')
plt.plot([x_pt, x_pt], [0, stats.norm.pdf(x_pt, 7.2, 1.5)], 'r--', linewidth=1.5)
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('f(x)')
plt.yticks([])

sns.despine(left=True, bottom=False, right=True, top=True, offset=0, trim=True)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

::: {.incremental}
1. **$F(x)$ is non-decreasing**: more area accumulates as $x$ increases.
2. **$F(-\infty) = 0$, $F(\infty) = 1$**: ranges from 0 to 1.
3. **$F(x)$ gives probability directly**: $P(X \leq 5) = F(5)$.

## Unknown Distributions
<p class="subheader">What can we say about an unknown population if all see see is the sample?</p>

**What we observe:**

- Sample size: $n = 50$
- Sample mean: $\bar{x} = 7.24$ hours
- Sample standard deviation: $s = 1.48$ hours

. . .

**What we want to know:**

- Population mean: $\mu = ?$
- Population standard deviation: $\sigma = ?$
- Population distribution: $f(x) = ?$

---

## Unknown Distributions
<p class="subheader">What can we say about an unknown population if all see see is the sample?</p>

The sample statistics ($\bar{x}, S$) are **not** the population parameters ($\mu, \sigma$).

$$\bar{x} \neq \mu$$
$$s \neq \sigma$$

## The Central Question
<p class="subheader">What can we say about an unknown population if all see see is the sample?</p>

<br><br>

:::{.incremental}
- Part 3.2 | **Central Limit Theorem** - the distribution of the sample mean
- Part 3.3 | **Confidence Intervals** - the closeness of the sample mean to the truth
- Part 3.4 | **Statiscial Modeling** - testing wrongness of hypothetical relationships
