## Statistics
<p class="subheader"> Why not just use visuals?</p>

*> A picture is worth a thousand summary stats.*

. . .

*> But sometimes we want something more precise and concrete.*

<br>

. . . 

**Q.** What is the ‘middle’ age in the class?

- Measures of Location: **Mean, Median, Mode**

. . .

**Q.** How spread out are the ages in the class?

- Measures of Dispersion / Spread: **Variance, Standard Deviation, Range**

---

## Measure of Central Tendency (Location)
<p class="subheader"> What is the "center" of the data?</p>

. . .

**Mode**: *the value that appears most often*

. . .

<br>

**Median**: *the value separating the higher and lower halves*

. . .

- If there are an odd number of values, choose the middle-ranked value
- If there are an even number of values, take the mean of the middle two

. . .

**Mean**: the center of mass

. . .

$$\bar{x} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + ... x_N}{N}$$

## Measure of Dispersion
<p class="subheader"> How spread out is the data?</p>

**Range**: difference between the largest and smallest value in the data

. . .

- Simple but doesn't respond to changes near the middle of the distribution 

. . .

**Mean Deviation**: difference between each value and the average

$$ \sum \frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{n} = \frac{X - \bar{X}}{n}$$

. . .

- Simple but the average of the difference is zero...

. . .

**Mean Absolute Deviation**: absolute value of the difference from the average

$$ \sum \frac{|x_i - \bar{x}|}{n} = \frac{|X - \bar{X}|}{n}$$

. . .

- The mean isn't zero
- A little more complex and isn't so nice mathematically

---

## Measure of Dispersion
<p class="subheader"> How spread out is the data?</p>

**Variance**: average squared difference from the mean

$$ Var(X) = \sum \frac{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n} = \frac{X - \bar{X}}{n}$$

. . .

- Treats negatives appropriately
- The mean isn't zero
- Mathematically nice
- Units are uninformative

---

## Measure of Dispersion
<p class="subheader"> How spread out is the data?</p>

**Standard Deviation**: a sort of average deviation from the mean

$$ \sigma_X = \sqrt{\sum \frac{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{X - \bar{X}}{n}}$$

. . .

- Treats negatives appropriately
- The mean isn't zero
- Mathematically nice
- Units are roughly average deviation from the mean

---

## Random Variables
<p class="subheader"> What is data? ... some fancy definitions....</p>

**Random Variable**: *a function that assigns a number to each possible outcome of a random process (discrete or continuous)*

. . .

*> the random variable is like a deck with any collection of cards*

. . .

**Probability Mass/Density Function**: *a function that assigns probabilities to each possible outcome*

. . .

*> the probability function is like which cards are in the deck*

. . .

**Observation**: *a realization of a random variable*
. . .

*> the observation is the card you drew*

. . .

**Sample**: *a collection of observations*

. . .

*> the sample is the record of cards you've drawn*

<br>

. . .

*> are the ages in the survey a random variable or observations?*

## Some Known Distributions
<p class="subheader"> ... some well understood random variables</p>

![](i/distributions.png){fig-align="center"}

## Random Variables: Known Distribution
<p class="subheader"> What is data?</p>

<br><br>

**If we know the distribution:**

. . .

- We can compute mean, standard deviation, etc.

. . .

- We can easily answer questions about the population. 

---

## Random Variables: Known Distribution
<p class="subheader"> Example: Rich Person Bet</p>

We'll toss a coin once:

- If it's heads, you get $10 million
- If it's tails, you pay $1 million

What are expected value (theoretical mean), variance, and standard deviation of the change in your wealth after this coin toss?

. . .

<br><br>

> lets solve this theoretically and by simulation in python

. . .

*> we'll find that the "sampling error" matches the distribution*

---

## Random Variables: Known Distribution
<p class="subheader"> Example: Bus Times </p>

. . .

1. If I arrive at a random time, what's my expected wait time until the next bus?

. . .

> find the expected value of wait time

. . .

2. What's the probability I'll have to wait more than 20 minutes?

. . .

> find the area under the curve beyond 20 minutes

. . .

3. What's the probability my wait will be between 5 and 15 minutes?

. . .

> find the area under the curve between 5 and 15 minutes

## Random Variables: Known Distribution
<p class="subheader"> Example: Manufaturing Defects </p>

Manufacturing defects of a part follow a normal distribution *(in cm)* with:

- `target_length = 100`
- `standard_error = 0.1`

<br>

. . .


We expect this to be normally distributed:

. . .

- Multiple independent factors contribute to each defect.
- Small defects are more common than large ones.
- Positive and negative defects are equally likely.

<p class="subheader"> Example: Manufaturing Defects </p>

Manufacturing defects of a part follow a normal distribution *(in cm)* with:

- `target_length = 100`
- `standard_error = 0.1`

. . .

1. How many parts will be shorter than 99 cm?

. . .

> find the area under the curve below 99 cm

. . .

2. How many parts will have defects greater than 1/2 cm?

. . .

> find the area under the curve between 100 - 1/2 and 100 + 1/2

## Random Variables
<p class="subheader"> ... main definitions</p>

**If we know the distribution:**

. . .

- We know the distribution, mean, standard deviation, etc.
  1. Probability function ($f$)
  2. Mean ($\mu$)
  3. Standard deviation ($\sigma$)

. . .

**If we don't know the distribution:**

. . .

- We can compute 
  1. Sample size ($n$)
  2. Sample mean ($\bar{x}$)
  3. Sample standard deviation ($S$)

- But how might we find the distribution?

## Random Variables: Unknown Distribution
<p class="subheader"> What is the distribution of ages in this class?</p>

- Sample size ($n$): 

- Sample mean ($\bar{x}$):

- Sample standard deviation ($S$):

. . .

*> these are descriptives of the ***sample** *not the distribution ($\mu \neq \bar{x}$)*

. . .

<br><br>

> see notebook

. . .

*> we cannot see the distribution... we only observe realizations from it*

. . .

*> what ***can** *we say about ages when we don't know the distribution?*
