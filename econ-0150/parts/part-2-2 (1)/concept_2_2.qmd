### *Part 2.2 | Grouping Data*

## Behavior Change: Starbucks Promo Offers
<p class="subheader">Q. Which promotional offers change behavior the most?</p>

<br><br>

- We have a dataset `starbucks_promotions.csv` with individual events (offers sent, transactions made)
- Each row represents one event with an Offer ID, Event type, and Revenue
- Raw data shows thousands of individual events

---

## Behavior Change: Starbucks Promo Offers
<p class="subheader">Q. Which promotional offers change behavior the most?</p>

```{python}
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('data/Starbucks_Promos.csv', index_col=0)
data.head()
```

*> looking at individual data won't easily tell us which offers work best...*

. . .

*> we need to **group** the data to see patterns*

---

## Grouping Data: The Process
<p class="subheader">Transform individual rows into group summaries.</p>

<br><br>

::: {.incremental}
1. **Filter** (if needed) - keep only relevant rows
2. **Group** - organize rows by categorical variables
3. **Aggregate** - summarize each group with statistics
:::

. . .

<br><br>

*> this transforms many rows into fewer, more meaningful summaries*

---

## Common Aggregation Functions
<p class="subheader">What can we calculate for each group?</p>

| Function | Purpose | Example Use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `.sum()` | Total values | Total revenue per offer |
| `.count()` | Number of rows | Number of events per offer |
| `.mean()` | Average values | Average transaction amount |
| `.max()` | Maximum value | Highest single transaction |
| `.min()` | Minimum value | Lowest transaction amount |

. . .

<br>

*> choose the aggregation that answers your question*

## Behavior Change: Starbucks Promo Offers
<p class="subheader">Q. Which promotional offers change behavior the most?</p>

<br><br>

1. How likely is each offer-type to be used?

. . .

2. What's the average revenue per offer-type?

---

## Grouping and Counting
<p class="subheader">How frequent is each offer-type?</p>

Lets start by counting each offer-type in the ***categorical variable*** `Offer ID`.

*> so Bogo 5 and 2off10 appear most frequently*

. . .

*> but how much revenue does each offer-type bring in?*

## Grouping and Summing
<p class="subheader">What is the total revenue for each offer-type?</p>

Lets find total revenue by `Offer ID`.

. . .

*> Bogo 5, 3off7, and 2off10 bring in the most revenue*

## Grouping and Counting
<p class="subheader">How frequent is each offer-type?</p>

Lets group on `Event` to count event-types.

Lets group on `Event` and find the total revenue by event-type.

. . .

*> just as we suspected, "offer" events brings in 0 revenue*

. . .

*> so `Event` tells us whether the row is an 'offer' or a 'transaction'*

## Grouping and Summing
<p class="subheader">What is the total revenue for each event-type?</p>

Lets group on `Event` and find the total revenue by event-type.

![](i/i_03.png)

*> so how many times was each offer-type actually sent?*

---

## Filtering, Grouping, and Counting
<p class="subheader">How many times was each offer-type sent?</p>

. . .

Lets filter `Event` for just 'offer' then group on `Offer ID` and count.

## Grouping and Averaging
<p class="subheader">What is the average transaction amount per offer type?</p>

Lets find the average (mean) transaction amount by offer-type.

---

## Grouping and Averaging
<p class="subheader">What is the average transaction amount per offer type?</p>

Lets find the average (mean) revenue we can expect after sending each offer-type.

. . .

*> this includes offers that were not accepted!*

---

## Filtering, Grouping, and Averaging
<p class="subheader">What's the average revenue per offer-type?</p>

Lets filter `Event` for just 'transaction' then group on `Offer ID` and find the average (mean) transaction amount.

. . .

*> no! we want to find how likely an offer will turn into a transaction when sent*

---

## Filtering, Grouping, and Transforming
<p class="subheader">How likely is each offer-type to be used?</p>

Lets divide the number of transactions by the number of offers sent by offer-type.

. . .

*> but lets also consider how much spending behavior changes too*

## Starbucks Offers: Conclusions
<p class="subheader">Q. Which promotional offers change behavior the most?</p>

<br><br>

1. The offer 3off7 has a high **redemption rate** but the discount may be costly.

. . .

*> people respond most to the 'best' deal*

. . .

2. The offer 5off20 has the highest **revenue** but a lower **redemption rate**.

. . .

*> people will spend the most when its required to redeam the offer*

. . .

3. The offer 2off10 is a more modest discount and is second in on **both metrics**.

## Part 2.4 | Grouping
<p class="subheader">Summary</p>

::: {.incremental}

- **Group** by relevant columns to quickly summarize data <br>
- **Aggregate** using *sum*, *count*, *mean*, *max*, etc.
