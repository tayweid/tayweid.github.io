## Summarizing Numerical Variables
<p class="subheader">... use the appropriate summary tool for the variable type</p>

---

## Numerical Variables: Histograms
<p class="subheader">Q. Which age group has the most Starbucks customers?</p>

![](i/i_01.png)

. . .

*> the bin sizes aren't even, making it hard to interpret*

<p class="subheader">Q. Which age group has the most Starbucks customers?</p>

![](i/i_02.png)

*> the bin sizes aren't even, making it hard to interpret*

---

## Histograms: Use equal sized bins
<p class="subheader">Q. Which age group has the most Starbucks customers?</p>

![](i/i_03.png)

. . .

*> but what if we want to distinguish between a 55 year old and a 60 year old?*

---

## Histograms: Use narrow enough bins
<p class="subheader">Q. Which age group has the most Starbucks customers?</p>

![](i/i_04.png)

. . .

*> what if we take this even further?*

*> what if we compare 44 year olds to 45 year olds?*

---

## Histograms: Avoid visualizing noise
<p class="subheader">Q. Do 44 or 45 year olds spend more at Starbucks?</p>

![](i/i_05.png)

. . .

*> we can go too far, introducing statistical noise. how do we fix the problem?*

. . .

*> increase the sample size or the bin width!*

## Histograms: Balance resolution vs noise
<p class="subheader">Q. Which age group has the most Starbucks customers?</p>

![](i/i_06.png)

*> larger sample has less noise!*

*> larger bins also has less noise!*

## Histograms: Summary
<p class="subheader">... use the right summary tool for the variable type</p>

<br><br>

:::{.incremental}
- Use histograms to visualize continuous variables.
- Make histograms with equally sized bins.
- Histograms with bins that are too narrow increase statistical noise, which can obscure underlying relationships.

## Exercise: Starbucks Customers Less Than $40k Income
<p class="subheader">... use Excel and/or Python</p>

<br><br>

Lets use the data to examine whether customers between 45 - 55 years old spend the most among customers making less than $40k.

**Data**: *`Starbucks_Customer_Profiles_40k.csv`*

## Numerical Variables: Histograms
<p class="subheader"> Q. Which countries drank an average amount of coffee?</p>

![](i/i_08.png)

. . .

*> histogram bins make it impossible to see the exact values*

## Numerical Variables: Histograms
<p class="subheader"> Q. Which countries drank the most coffee in 1999?</p>

![](i/i_08.png)

. . .

*> again, histograms make it difficult to see statistical measures*

---

## Numerical Variables: Boxplots
<p class="subheader"> Q. Which countries drank the most coffee in 1999?</p>

![](i/i_09.png)

. . .

*> as we'll see, boxplots can tell us about quartiles*

. . .

*> but boxplots are still pretty unclear for our question*

## Boxplots + Stripplots
<p class="subheader"> Q. Which countries drank the most coffee in 1999?</p>

![](i/i_10.png)

*> here we can see the datapoints directly with the boxplot*

. . .

*> each point represents a country's coffee consumption*

---

## Boxplots + Stripplots
<p class="subheader"> Q. Which countries drank the most coffee in 1999?</p>

![](i/i_11.png)

*> each element of the boxplot represents one of these five quartiles*

---

## Boxplots + Stripplots
<p class="subheader">Which country consumed the most coffee per capita?</p>

. . .

*> we can find the exact values according to quartiles*

## Boxplots + Stripplots
<p class="subheader">Which country consumed the least coffee per capita?</p>

## Boxplots + Stripplots: Summary
<p class="subheader">Boxplots show quartiles; stripplots show the data.</p>

<br><br>

:::{.incremental}
- Boxplots make it easy to show the quartiles.
- Stripplots can show the distribution of the data.
- We can highlight subsets of the data.

## Exercise: Boxplots + Stripplots

<br><br>

Lets use a boxplot and stripplot to examine the distribution of coffee consumption per capita among coffee-importing countries in 2019.

- **Data:** `Coffee_Per_Cap_2019.csv`
