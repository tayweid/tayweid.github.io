## ECON 0150 | Economic Data Analysis {.center}
<p class="subheader-center">The economist's data analysis skillset.</p>

<br>

### *Part 1.4 | Panel Data (Long Format)*

---

## Panel Data
<p class="subheader">Data with repeated observations across entities AND time</p>

<br>

::: {.incremental}
- **Panel data** tracks the same units (people, countries, stores) over time
- Examples: GDP by country by year, sales by store by hour
- Can be stored in two formats: **Long** or **Wide**
:::

---

## Long Format Panel Data
<p class="subheader">Each observation is a separate row</p>

| Hours | Shop |
|-------|------|
| 12 | Shop A |
| 15 | Shop A |
| 14 | Shop A |
| 16 | Shop A |
| 19 | Shop A |
| ... | ... |

. . .

*> each transaction is a row; a column identifies the group*

## Labor Demand: Hiring a Barista
<p class="subheader">Use Coffee_Sales_Receips.csv to help understand where to hire a new barista.</p>

<br>

- You manage three coffee shops and are considering where to hire a new barista.
- You have a dataset containing information about the transactions taking place at all three coffee shops throughout the day.
- Lets consider how to use this data to inform our decision.

## Part 1.4 | Panel Data (Long Format)

<br><br>

#### Summary

::: {.incremental}
- **Panel data** tracks repeated observations across groups or time
- **Long format:** Each observation is a row; a column identifies the group
- **Faceting** separates each group into its own panel for comparison
- **Line graphs** simplify multiple categories on a single plot
- Use `hue='Group'` and `col='Group'` for multi-group visualizations
:::

## S-T-E for Panel Data (Long Format)
<p class="subheader">What we just did</p>

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| SELECT | All transactions from three coffee shops |
| TRANSFORM | Group by shop and hour; count transactions |
| ENCODE | Hour → x-position; Count → y-position; Shop → color/facet |

. . .

*> TRANSFORM groups by multiple variables; ENCODE uses color or faceting to show groups*

## Exercise 1.4 | Coffee Shop Transactions
<p class="subheader">Use Coffee_Sales_Receips.csv to help inform where to hire a barista.</p>

. . .

```{.python}
# Load Dataset
sales = pd.read_csv(file_path + 'Coffee_Sales_Reciepts.csv')
sales.head()
```

. . .

| Hours | Shop |
|-------|------|
| 12 | Shop A |
| 15 | Shop A |
| 14 | Shop A |
| 16 | Shop A |
| 19 | Shop A |
| ... | ... |

*> you'll see a few more columns in your dataset*

. . .

*> this is **Long-Format Panel Data**: transactions are all in the same column*

sns.displot(sales, x='Hours', col='Shop', bins=range(0,24,1))
```

. . .

## Exercise 1.4 | Count Hourly by Shop
<p class="subheader">Q. Which shift is the busiest?</p>

```{.python}
# Create hourly counts by shop
hourly_counts = sales.groupby(['Shop', 'Hours']).size().reset_index(name='Count')
```

. . .

| Shop | Hours | Count |
|------|-------|-------|
| Shop A | 6 | 12 |
| Shop A | 7 | 28 |
| Shop A | 8 | 45 |
| Shop A | 9 | 52 |
| Shop A | 10 | 48 |
| ... | ... | ... |

. . .

```{.python}
# Multi-Lineplot
sns.lineplot(hourly_counts, x='Hours', y='Count', hue='Shop')
```

---

## Exercise 1.4 | Multiple Line Graph
<p class="subheader">Q. Which shift is the busiest?</p>

```{.python}

## Looking Ahead: Part 1.5
<p class="subheader">Sometimes we need data in a different shape</p>

<br>

::: {.incremental}
- What if we want to compare 1999 vs 2019 directly?
- Long format makes this awkward — we'd need to filter and merge
- **Wide format** puts each time period in its own column
- In Part 1.5, we'll learn to reshape between formats
