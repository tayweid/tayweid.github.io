## Organizational ToDo List

- Part 1.0 needs to be rewritten. it's not interesting enough. i've already added an outline for how to change it. it just needs to be written.
- many early parts in 1 need to change the image names from i_xx to c_xx. 
- many early exercises need to have the permanant blank exercise to link for students, an in-class version, and a solutions which can go on the website.
- Part 1.5 still has some R code from Jana that I need to convert to python or update away.
- Part 1.6 needs to be better. Make the example simpler or just make a simpler exercise. Then write notes. The homework is already pretty good.
- Part 2.1 is just boring. And it's too long. Make it simpler and less boring. I want a more interesting question to ask. The one I have is boring: relationship between age and distance from school (no relationship). It's good to mention null relationships and the importance of reporting them. But not compelling enough.
