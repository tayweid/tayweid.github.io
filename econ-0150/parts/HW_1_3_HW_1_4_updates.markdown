Ok so I want to move the timeseries part of bivariate (GDP and Production) into timeseries. I think maybe we move Bivariate (mostly as is) to be Part 1.3 to follow cross-section. Then scatterplot is on the table for Timeseries to do bivariate timeseries. Timeseries would naturally follow as Part 1.4 and then Panel as Part 1.5.

Add this extra homework to timeseries and panel. There's the aggregate variables to talk about for timeseries, both as single variables and then as a bivariate relationship between variables.

Then there's the panel structure, with changes through time.
