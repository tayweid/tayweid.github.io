## *Part 1.0 | Variable Types*

We cannot typically understand our data without summarizing it. 

![](i/visualizations.png)

. . .

The main differentiators between a good and bad summarization tools is the dimension of the data and what you're trying to understand about the data. 

---

## Dimensions of Data
<p class="subheader">Data comes in all shapes, sizes, and types.</p>

**Variable Type**

- Categorical data
- Numerical data

. . .

**Data Structure**

- Cross-sectional data
- Time series data
- Panel data

. . .

**Number of Variables**

- Univariate (n=1)
- Bivariate (n=2)
- Multivariate (n>2)

## Variable Types: Categorical
<p class="subheader">... data that's best recorded in categories</p>

**Binary**: only two categories

- Economics major (YES/NO)
- Human (YES/NO)

. . .

**Nominal**: categories cannot be ordered / ranked

- Blood types (A, B, AB, 0)
- Colors (Red, Blue, Green)

. . .

**Ordinal**: categories have order / rank but not a meaningful scale

- Education levels (High School, Bachelor's, Master's, PhD)
- Survey responses (Strongly Disagree, Neutral, Agree, Strongly Agree)
- Size categories (Small, Medium, Large)

---

## Variable Types: Numerical
<p class="subheader">... data that's best recorded in numerical form</p>

**Discrete**: countable numbers with meaningful intervals\

- Number of children in a household (1, 2, ... )
- Number of siblings (1, 2, ... )

. . .

**Continuous**: quantities measurable on the reals

- Household income
- US GDP

## Exercise 1.0 | Variable Types

<br><br>

Lets identify the variable type for each dataset.

- **Dataset 1:** `employment_status.csv`
- **Dataset 2:** `employment_sector.csv`
- **Dataset 3:** `economic_optimism.csv`
- **Dataset 4:** `household_size.csv`
- **Dataset 5:** `household_income.csv`

---

## Exercise: Employment Status
<p class="subheader">What type of variables are contained in `employment_status.csv`?</p>

<br>

. . .

**Binary Categorical**: two categories *(Employed, Unemployed)*

---

## Exercise: Employment Sector
<p class="subheader">What type of variables are contained in `employment_sector.csv`?</p>

<br>

. . .

**Nominal**: no inherent order *(Agriculture, Services, Unemployed)*

![](i/i_02.png)

---

## Exercise: Economic Optimism
<p class="subheader">What type of variables are contained in `economic_optimism.csv`?</p>

<br>

. . .

**Ordinal**: meaningful order without meaningful intervals *(Very Pessimistic to Very Optimistic)*

![](i/i_03.png)

---

## Exercise: Household Size
<p class="subheader">What type of variables are contained in `household_size.csv`?</p>

<br>

. . .

**Discrete Numerical**: countable numbers with meaningful intervals *(Number of Children in a Household)*

![](i/i_04.png)

---

## Exercise: Household Income
<p class="subheader">What type of variables are contained in `household_income.csv`?</p>

<br>

. . .

**Continuous Numerical**: quantities measurable on the reals *(Income in USD)*

## Exercise 1.3 | Data Structures

<br><br>

Lets identify the data structure for each dataset.

- **Dataset 1:** `household_savings.csv`
- **Dataset 2:** `us_real_gdp.csv`
- **Dataset 3:** `household_incomes.csv`

---

## Exercise: Dataset 1
<p class="subheader">`household_savings.csv` is a Cross-Sectional Dataset</p>

. . .

**Clue**: Each household (the unit of observation) appears only once.
