### *Part 1.3 | Data Structures and Relationships Through Time*

---

## Data Structures
<p class="subheader">...three main relationships between data points.</p>

The way we understand data depends on the relationship between the data points.

| | Cross-Sectional | Time-Series | Panel Data |
|-|----|---|----|
| **Focus** | Multiple units, one time point | One unit, many times | Multiple units, many time points |
| **Shape** | Wide format | Long format | Long format |
| **Ex.** | Household income, 2025 | US GDP,   10 years | Household income, 10 years |

<br>

. . .

*> we've spent the first part of the class on cross-sectional data*

. . .

*> we'll spend a bit of time on panel and geographic data later*

## Timeseries: Summary
<p class="subheader">Linegraphs show trends; multi-boxplots show between-period patterns.</p>

<br><br>

:::{.incremental}
- Use a ***linegraph*** to show a numerical variable through time.
- Highlight changes in a linegraph using ***shading***.
- Use a ***multi-boxplot*** to show the distribution between multiple periods.

## Exercise: Timeseries

<br><br>

Lets use a linegraph and a multi-boxplot to examine the trends and seasonal patterns of coffee prices.

- **Data:** `Coffee_Prices.csv`
