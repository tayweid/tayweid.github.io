Does eating ice cream cause drowning?

## The Puzzle {.center}

![](0_efoKnWPgdHYKJkq1.png){fig-align="center" width="60%"}

. . .

*Everyone knows correlation doesn't imply causation...*

. . .

*...but what does that really mean?*

---

## A Concerning Discovery {.center}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**The Data:**

- Ice cream sales (cubic meters)
- Drowning deaths  
- Years: 2010-2018
- Source: Danish Statistics
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

:::

. . .

*There appears to be a relationship between ice cream consumption and drowning deaths*

---

## The Correlation is Real {.center}

![](1_MDiHRzAXb6RXqvtmkZ6y8A.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

. . .

**Pearson correlation: r = 0.78**

. . .

*This is a strong positive correlation!*

---

## Should We Ban Ice Cream? {.center}

. . .

### Three Possible Explanations

. . .

**Hypothesis A:** Ice cream → Swimming → Drowning

*Eating ice cream makes people want to swim*

. . .

**Hypothesis B:** Drowning → Ice cream sales

*News of drownings drives sympathy ice cream consumption?*

. . .

**Hypothesis C:** ???

*Something else is going on...*

---

## Let's Look at the Timing {.center}

![](1_A_Nww3-R5RMvaYK7NdwUyg.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

. . .

*Both ice cream sales and drowning deaths follow a seasonal pattern*

---

## The Monthly Pattern {.center}

![](1_s_2eOQ4yf4DbVegZFUpLIQ.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

. . .

*Summer months show high values for both variables*

. . .

*Winter months show low values for both variables*

---

## The True Relationship {.center}

![](1_qrl33ad9KXvutWBcjB4W_w.png){fig-align="center" width="60%"}

. . .

**Season is a confounding variable:**

- Season → Temperature → Ice cream sales
- Season → Water activities → Drowning risk

. . .

*The correlation between ice cream and drowning is spurious*

## Testing Causal Hypotheses {.center}

*Direct causation?*

*Which model better explains the data?*

## What About Other Explanations? {.center}

![](1_KPmqjjgJJe_DRDrpugO1sg.png){fig-align="center" width="50%"}

. . .

Could temperature and sunshine **independently** affect both?

. . .

*This is still confounding, just with multiple pathways*

---

## The Statistical Lesson {.center}

### Correlation ≠ Causation Because:

. . .

1. **Confounding variables** can create spurious correlations

. . .

2. **Domain knowledge** is essential for causal inference

. . .

3. **Temporal patterns** can reveal hidden relationships

. . .

*This is why we need to think carefully about our models*

---

## Connecting to Regression {.center}

When we run a regression:

$$\text{Drownings} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{IceCream} + \varepsilon$$

. . .

We might find $\beta_1 > 0$ and significant

. . .

**But this doesn't mean ice cream causes drowning!**

. . .

*The "least wrong predictions" might use a spurious relationship*

---

## The Fix: Control Variables {.center}

$$\text{Drownings} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{IceCream} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{Temperature} + \varepsilon$$

. . .

Once we control for temperature (or season):

- $\beta_1$ becomes insignificant
- $\beta_2$ captures the real effect

. . .

*This is why we include control variables in regression*

---

## Key Takeaways {.center}

::: {.incremental}
- **Always visualize your data** - patterns matter
- **Think about mechanisms** - how would X cause Y?
- **Consider confounders** - what affects both X and Y?
- **Time matters** - temporal patterns reveal relationships
- **Domain knowledge is crucial** - statistics alone isn't enough
:::

. . .

*Remember: Your model might make good predictions for the wrong reasons*

---

## Application to Economics {.center}

Similar spurious correlations appear everywhere:

. . .

- **Stock prices** and **butter production** in Bangladesh
- **Nicolas Cage movies** and **swimming pool drownings**  
- **Murder rates** and **ice cream sales**

. . .

*The world is full of confounding variables*

. . .

**Your job as an economist:** Find the true causal relationships
