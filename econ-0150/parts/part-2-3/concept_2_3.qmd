## ECON 0150 | Economic Data Analysis {.center}
<p class="subheader-center">The economist's data analysis skillset.</p>

<br>

### *Part 2.3 | Numerical by Numerical by Category*

---

## Economic Realignment
<p class="subheader">Has American politics become more geographically divided along economic lines?</p>

<br><br>

::: {.incremental}
- Do wealthy and poor counties vote differently now than twenty years ago?
- This is the kind of question you might explore in a final project.
- This question requires combining data from multiple sources.
:::

. . .

<br>

***Question:** Has the relationship between income and voting changed?*

---

## The Data
<p class="subheader">Two datasets, each answering different questions</p>

<br>

**Dataset 1: Income by County**

- Median household income for each U.S. county
- From the Census

. . .

<br>

**Dataset 2: Elections by County**

- Democratic vote share for each county
- Multiple years: 2000, 2004, ..., 2024
- Includes total votes cast (proxy for county size)

---

## Question 1: Do Counties Vote Differently Today?
<p class="subheader">Compare county distributions between 2000 and 2024.</p>

<br>

. . .

This is a **Part 2.2 (or 1.4)** question: a numerical variable across categories.

. . .

<br>


```{.python}
# Use a box+stripplot
sns.boxplot(data_long, x='Year', y='dem_share', whis=(0,100))
sns.stripplot(data_long.sample(400), x='Year', y='dem_share')
```

---

## Democratic Vote Share by Year
<p class="subheader">Counties shifted Republican on average</p>

![](i/dem_share_by_year.png)

. . .

*> median dropped from 41% to 29% — but why were elections still close?*

---

## Question 2: Do Large Counties Vote Differently?
<p class="subheader">Lets try to explaining the paradox.</p>

<br>

- Counties aren't equal in population.
- Small rural counties outnumber large urban ones.

. . .

<br>

***Question:** Do larger counties lean Democratic?*

. . .

<br>

This is a **Part 2.1 question** — a relationship between two numerical variables.

```{.python}
# Use log votes
data['log_votes_2024'] = np.log(data['total_votes_2024'])
```

. . .

```{.python}
# Plot using lmplot (scatterplot is good too)
sns.lmplot(data, x='log_votes_2024', y='dem_share_2024')
```

---

## Do Large Counties Vote Differently?
<p class="subheader">Large counties vote more Democratic</p>

![](i/size_vs_dem_2024.png)

. . .

*> Democratic-leaning counties are larger (correlation: 0.49)*

---

## Question 3: Is This Related to Income?
<p class="subheader">Large counties tend to be richer. Is income related to voting?</p>

<br>

. . .

***Question:** Is the Democratic lean related to income?*

. . .

<br>

This is another **Part 2.1 question**.

```{.python}
# Use log income
data['log_income'] = np.log(data['income'])
```

```{.python}
# Use lmplot for a best fit line
sns.lmplot(data, x='log_income', y='dem_share_2024')
```

---

## Income and Democratic Voting (2024)
<p class="subheader">Richer counties vote more Democratic</p>

![](i/income_vs_dem_2024.png)

. . .

*> correlation: 0.25 — but was it always this way?*

---

## Question 4: Has the Relationship Changed?
<p class="subheader">Have higher income counties always leaned Democratic?</p>

<br>

Prior tools fall short:

::: {.incremental}
- **Part 2.1 (scatter):** Shows one year at a time
- **Part 2.2 (boxplot):** Ignores the income relationship entirely
:::

. . .

<br>

*> neither tool shows how the relationship between two numerical variables varies by category*

---

## New Tool: Scatter by Category
<p class="subheader">Color points by year to see how the relationship differs</p>

<br>

. . .

We need a scatter plot that shows bivariate relationships separately by category.

. . .

<br>

```{.python}
# Log income in the long format dataset
data_long['log_income'] = np.log(data_long['income'])
```

. . .

```{.python}
# Use lmplot with hue for the category
sns.lmplot(data_long, x='log_income', y='dem_share', hue='Year')
```

---

## Income and Democratic Voting: 2000 vs 2024
<p class="subheader">The relationship has flipped</p>

![](i/income_vs_dem_by_year.png)

. . .

*> in 2000, richer counties leaned Republican; by 2024, they lean Democratic*

---

## The Insight
<p class="subheader">Each question built on the previous</p>

<br><br>

::: {.incremental}
- **Q1:** Counties shifted Republican on average
- **Q2:** But large counties vote Democratic (explains why elections are close)
- **Q3:** Richer counties vote Democratic
- **Q4:** This relationship completely flipped since 2000
:::

---

## Merging Datasets
<p class="subheader">Combining income and election data</p>

<br>

To answer Q2-Q4, we needed data from multiple sources.

. . .

<br>

```{.python}
data = pd.merge(income, elections, on='county_fips')
```

. . .

<br>

*> the merge matches 3,106 of ~3,200 counties — 97% success*

---

## The Workflow
<p class="subheader">A template for final projects</p>

<br><br>

::: {.incremental}
1. **Q1 (Part 2.2):** Boxplot by year — counties shifted Republican
2. **Q2 (Part 2.1):** Scatter of size vs. voting — large counties vote Democratic
3. **Q3 (Part 2.1):** Scatter of income vs. voting — richer counties vote Democratic
4. **Q4 (Part 2.3):** Scatter by category — the relationship flipped

## Part 2.3 | Summary

<br><br>

::: {.incremental}
- **Part 2.1 tools** (scatter) show relationships between two numerical variables
- **Part 2.2 tools** (boxplot) show how a numerical variable differs by category
- **Part 2.3 tools** (scatter by category) show how a *relationship* differs by category
- **Merging** combines datasets when your question requires variables from both
