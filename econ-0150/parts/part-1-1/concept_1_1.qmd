### *Part 1.1 | Summarizing Categorical Variables*

## Summarizing Categorical Variables
<p class="subheader">... use the appropriate summary tool for the variable type</p>

---

## Catagorical Variables: Visualizations
<p class="subheader">Q. Which state has the most locations?</p>

![](i/i_01.png)

*> pay attention to which of these two figures is easier to answer the question*

. . .

*> it's pretty easy to see that it's CA from both of these figures* 

---

## Catagorical Variables: Visualizations
<p class="subheader">Q. Does FL or WA have more shops?</p>

![](i/i_01.png)

*> pay attention to which of these two figures is easier to answer the question*

. . .

*> a bar graph is much easier to read* 

---

## Catagorical Variables: Visualizations
<p class="subheader">Q. How many shops are in FL?</p>

![](i/i_01.png)

*> pay attention to which of these two figures is easier to answer the question*

. . .

*> now it takes a second to read the bar graph...* 

---

## Catagorical Variables: Bar Plots
<p class="subheader">Q. How many shops are in FL?</p>

![](i/i_02.png)

*> pay attention to which of these two figures is easier to answer the question*

. . .

*> we can make the bar graph easier to read by placing the number near the bar*

---

## Catagorical Variables: Remove Clutter
<p class="subheader">Q. How many shops are in the state with the second most locations?</p>

![](i/i_03.png)

*> removing clutter guides your eye to the important information*

---

## Catagorical Variables: Remove Clutter
<p class="subheader">Q. How many shops are in the state with the second most locations?</p>

![](i/i_04.png)

*> removing clutter guides your eye to the important information*

---

## Catagorical Variables: Order by Size
<p class="subheader">Q. How many shops are in the state with the second most locations?</p>

![](i/i_05.png)

*> states have no inherent order, but sorting can make comparisons easier*

---

## Binary Categorical Variables: CA vs Other
<p class="subheader">Q. How does CA compare to the whole?</p>

![](i/i_06.png)

. . .

*> instead of a nominal categorical variable, this is binary (CA / Other)*

---

## Binary Categorical Variables: Binary Visualization
<p class="subheader">Q. How does CA compare to the whole?</p>

![](i/i_07.png)

. . .

*> this question is much easier to see when visualizing the two categories*

. . .

*> here both the pie and the bar communicte the data effectively*

---

## Binary Categorical Variables: Percentages
<p class="subheader">Q. How does CA compare to the whole?</p>

![](i/i_08.png)

*> if the question is about percentages, a pie chart may work best*

---

## Takeaways
<p class="subheader">... use the right summary tool for the variable type</p>

::: {.incremental}
- Binary Categorical Variables: use a **pie chart** or **bar graph**
- Nominal Categorical Variables: use a **bar graph**; maybe order by value
- Ordinal Categorical Variables: use an **ordered bar graph**
- Remove clutter; keep it simple
- Place information near the object it describes

## Exercises 1.1 | Categorical Variables

Lets visualize coffee shops by state.

- **Dataset 1:** `Coffee_Shops.csv`

<br><br>

Lets visualize the main variable in each dataset.

- **Dataset 2:** `employment_status.csv`
- **Dataset 3:** `household_savings.csv`
- **Dataset 4:** `household_incomes.csv`

## Exercise: Dataset 1
<p class="subheader">Summarize `Coffee_Shops.csv` as a nominal categorical variable.</p>

. . .

```{.python}
# Load Dataset
shops = pd.read_csv(file_path + 'Coffee_Shops.csv')
```

. . .

```{.python}
# Summary Table
shops.value_counts()
```

. . .

```{.python}
# Countplot (bar plot)
sns.countplot(data=shops, y='STATE', hue='STATE')
```

. . .

## Exercise: Dataset 1
<p class="subheader">Summarize `Coffee_Shops.csv` as a binary categorical variable.</p>

```{.python}
# Load Dataset
shops = pd.read_csv(file_path + 'Coffee_Shops.csv')
```

```{.python}
# Create a binary categorical variable
shops['CA'] = np.where(shops['STATE'] == 'CA', 'CA', 'Other')
```

. . .

```{.python}
# Countplot
sns.countplot(data=shops, y='CA', hue='CA')
```
