##### Q1. Transforming Marriage Rates

The following questions are based on **crude marriage rates** in `marriage_rates.csv` — numbers of marriages per one thousand inhabitants — in 1990 and 2019. Each row represents a different European country.

a) Create a multi-boxplot comparing the distribution of marriage rates in 1990 vs 2019. Based on the boxplots, did marriage rates generally increase or decrease across European countries?

b) Create a new column of absolute change in marriage rates from 1990 to 2019. Compute the **absolute change** in the marriage rate by subtracting the old value from the new value. Which country in this dataset has the largest absolute change between these years? (*Hint: do not take an absolute value; treat 1 as larger than -2.*)

c) Create a new column of relative change in marriage rates from 1990 to 2019. Compute the **relative change** as the ratio resulting from dividing the absolute change by the old value. Which country in this dataset has the largest relative change between these years?

d) Create a scatterplot comparing marriage rates in 1990 (x-axis) vs 2019 (y-axis). Add a 45-degree line to show where countries would fall if their marriage rate stayed the same. How many countries are above the line? What does being above the line mean?
