## Recap Part 1.4 | Long Format Panel Data
<p class="subheader">Each row represents an observation of an entity at one point in time</p>

. . .

*> we need a way to compare each country's consumption in 1999 vs 2019*

. . .

*> but in long format, this is hard — the data is spread across different rows*

## Wide Format Panel Data
<p class="subheader">What if each year was its own column?</p>

. . .

<br>

| Code | 1999 | 2004 | 2009 | 2014 | 2019 |

| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

. . .

*> now comparing 1999 vs 2019 is just comparing two columns!*

## Wide Format

## Two Formats, Same Data
<p class="subheader">Panel data can be stored in two ways</p>

<br>

::: {.incremental}
- **Wide format:** Each time period is a separate column
- **Long format:** Each observation is a separate row
- Same information, different shapes
- Different shapes make different tasks easier

## Exercise 1.5 | Scatterplots
<p class="subheader">Is the world drinking more coffee?</p>

We're going to use a scatterplot to visually examine how countries' coffee consumption changed between 1999 and 2019.

- **Data:** `Coffee_Per_Cap.csv`

---

## Exercise 1.5 | Scatterplots
<p class="subheader">Is the world drinking more coffee?</p>

```{.python}
# Wide Format Scatterplot
sns.scatterplot(percap, x='1999', y='2019')
```

## Exercise 1.5 | Scatterplots

## Counting Changes
<p class="subheader">How many countries increased vs decreased?</p>

![](i/i_20.png)

. . .

*> we can see visually that most points are above the 45° line*

. . .

*> but how do we count exactly how many?*

---

## Counting Changes
<p class="subheader">How many countries increased vs decreased?</p>

1. **Create a change column:** Subtract old from new

| Code | 1999 | 2019 | change |
|------|------|------|--------|
| AUT | 8.43 | 7.93 | -0.50 |
| BGR | 2.65 | 3.64 | 0.99 |
| HRV | 4.48 | 5.62 | 1.14 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

::: {.incremental}
2. **Filter:** Select rows where change > 0 (or < 0)
3. **Count:** Use `len()` to count the filtered rows
:::

. . .

*> positive change = increased; negative change = decreased*

---

## Exercise 1.5 | Counting Changes
<p class="subheader">How many countries increased their coffee consumption?</p>

```{.python}
# Create a change column
percap['change'] = percap['2019'] - percap['1999']
percap.head()
```

. . .

<br>

```{.python}
# Count countries that increased (change > 0)
increased = percap[percap['change'] > 0]
len(increased)
```

. . .

<br>

```{.python}
# Count countries that decreased (change < 0)
decreased = percap[percap['change'] < 0]
len(decreased)
```

## Part 1.5 | Panel Data (Wide Format)

<br><br>

#### Summary

::: {.incremental}
- **Wide format:** Each time period is a column
- **Multi-boxplots** compare distributions across time
- **Scatterplots with 45° lines** track individual changes
- **Filtering** with `df[df['col'] > 0]` counts subsets
