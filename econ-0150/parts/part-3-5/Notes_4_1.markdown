## Part 4.1 | Minimizing Sum of Squared Errors

### The sample mean is simplest model that minimizes the sum of squared errors.

### Hypothesis testing is the simplest linear model.



- So far in part 3 we've built a model that allows us to not need to know the underlying population distribution to answer questions about the population mean.
- The sampling distribution approaches a t-distribution with a standard deviation of the sample standard error
