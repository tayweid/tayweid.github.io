### *Part 2.5 | Merging Data*

---

## Final Project Preview
<p class="subheader">Exploring real questions with real data</p>

<br><br>

Lets start working through a project together:

::: {.incremental}
- **Question 1**: Were there systematic patterns in vote share changes between 2020 and 2024?
- **Question 2**: Do income levels relate to these voting shifts?
- **Data**: MIT Election Lab (county-level returns) + Census (median income)
:::

. . .

<br>

*> this is the kind of analysis you'll do for your final project*

---

## The Data Challenge
<p class="subheader">We have two separate datasets that need to be connected</p>

<br>

**Dataset 1**: Presidential election results by county

- County name
- State
- Vote counts for 2020
- Vote counts for 2024

. . .

**Dataset 2**: Median household income by county

- County identifier
- Median income

---

## Step 1: Explore Vote Shares
<p class="subheader">Q. What do county-level vote shares look like?</p>

First understand what we're working with.

. . .

```{.python}
# Histogram of 2024 vote shares
sns.histplot(elections, x='2020')
```

. . .

```{.python}
# Histogram of 2024 vote shares
sns.histplot(elections, x='2024')
```

---

## Step 2: Compare Elections
<p class="subheader">Q. How did county vote shares change between 2020 and 2024?</p>

Second, lets look at the relationship between Democratic Share in 2020 and 2024.

```{.python}
# Scatterplot comparing elections
sns.scatterplot(elections, x='2020', y='2024', alpha=0.5)

# Add 45-degree line
plt.plot([0,1], [0,1], 'r--', alpha=0.5)
```

. . .

*> points above the line shifted more Democratic*

*> points below the line shifted more Republican*

. . .

*> but what explains these shifts?*

---

## Step 3: Add Income Data
<p class="subheader">Q. Does county income relate to voting shifts?</p>

To answer this, we need to:

::: {.incremental}
1. Load the income data
2. **Merge** it with our election data
3. Calculate the vote share change
4. Visualize the relationship
:::

. . .

<br>

*> but how do we connect two separate datasets?*

---

## Merging Data: The Concept
<p class="subheader">Combining datasets based on common identifiers</p>

<br>

**The Key**: Find a common column that uniquely identifies observations

<br>

::: {.incremental}
- In our case: County FIPS codes (Federal Information Processing Standards)
- FIPS uniquely identify every US county
- Format: State code (2 digits) + County code (3 digits) = 5 digits total
:::

. . .

<br>

*> example: Allegheny County, PA = 42003*

---

## Types of Merges
<p class="subheader">Different ways to combine datasets</p>

| Merge Type | Description | Example |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| **1:1** | Each row in A matches exactly one row in B | County → County |
| **1:m** | One row in A matches multiple rows in B | State → Counties |
| **m:1** | Multiple rows in A match one row in B | Counties → State |

. . .

<br>

*> our county merge is 1:1 - each county appears once in each dataset*

---

## Step 3: Perform the Merge
<p class="subheader">Combining our datasets</p>

```{.python}
# Merge datasets on county FIPS
data = pd.merge(elections, 
                  income, 
                  left_on='county_fips',
                  right_on='county_fips',
                  how='inner')
```

. . .

**Merge options:**

- `inner`: Keep only counties in both datasets
- `left`: Keep all counties from elections data
- `right`: Keep all counties from income data  
- `outer`: Keep all counties from either dataset

. . .

*> we use 'inner' to focus on counties with complete data*

---

## Step 4: Calculate Vote Shifts
<p class="subheader">Creating our analysis variable</p>

```{.python}
# Calculate the shift in Democratic vote share
data['dem_shift'] = data['2024'] - data['2016']
```

. . .

```{.python}
# Summarize this new variable
sns.histplot(elections, x='dem_shift')
```

. . .

*> now we can explore the relationship with income*

---

## Step 5: Analyze the Relationship
<p class="subheader">Q. Does county income relate to voting shifts?</p>

```{.python}
# Scatterplot of income vs vote shift
sns.scatterplot(data, 
                x='median_income', 
                y='dem_shift',
                alpha=0.3)

# Add horizontal line at zero
plt.axhline(y=0, color='r', linestyle='--', alpha=0.5)

plt.xlabel('Median Household Income ($)')
plt.ylabel('Change in Democratic Vote Share (2024-2016)')
```

. . .

*> what patterns do you see?*

---

## Common Merge Issues
<p class="subheader">Watch out for these problems</p>

<br>

::: {.incremental}
- **Missing values**: Some counties might not have income data
- **Duplicate keys**: Same county appearing multiple times
- **Type mismatches**: FIPS stored as numbers vs strings
- **Different naming**: "St. Louis" vs "Saint Louis"
:::

. . .

<br>

```{.python}
# Check for duplicates before merging
elections['county_fips'].duplicated().sum()
income['FIPS'].duplicated().sum()
```

---

## Summary
<p class="subheader">Merging allows us to answer richer questions</p>

<br><br>

::: {.incremental}
- **Identify** common columns to join on (FIPS codes)
- **Prepare** data for merging (create consistent identifiers)
- **Merge** using appropriate join type (inner, left, right, outer)
- **Transform** to create analysis variables (vote shift)
- **Analyze** the combined dataset
