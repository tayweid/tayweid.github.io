# Data Operations Practice

---

## Practice 1: Trace the Filter
<p class="subheader">Which products remain after filtering?</p>

| Product_ID | Category | Price | In_Stock |
|------------|----------|-------|----------|
| P001 | Electronics | 299 | True |
| P002 | Clothing | 49 | False |
| P003 | Electronics | 89 | True |
| P004 | Food | 12 | True |
| P005 | Clothing | 79 | True |

**Filter:** `(Price < 100) AND (In_Stock == True)`

. . .

*Answer: P003, P004, P005*

---

## Practice 2: Multi-Step Operations
<p class="subheader">Track data through multiple transformations</p>

| Sale_ID | Store | Amount |
|---------|-------|--------|
| S001 | North | 120 |
| S002 | South | 80 |
| S003 | North | 150 |
| S004 | South | 90 |
| S005 | North | 100 |

**Operations:**

1. Filter for Amount >= 100
2. Group by Store
3. Calculate mean Amount

. . .

*Answer: North mean = 123.33 (from 120, 150, 100)*

---

## Practice 3: Data Cleaning Decisions
<p class="subheader">What cleaning is needed for each entry?</p>

| Response_ID | Duration |
|------------|----------|
| R001 | "5 minutes" |
| R002 | "180" |
| R003 | "about 3 min" |
| R004 | "N/A" |

For each entry, select ALL that apply:

. . .

**R001:** [Extract number] [Remove text] [Convert type]

. . .

**R002:** [Convert type]

. . .

**R003:** [Extract number] [Remove text] [Convert type]

. . .

**R004:** [Handle missing]

---

## Practice 4: Build Complex Filters
<p class="subheader">Construct the correct boolean logic</p>

**Goal:** Find all employees who:

- Work in either Tech or Sales departments
- AND have been with company more than 2 years
- AND earn less than $70,000

. . .

Use these components to construct a filter:

1. (Department == 'Tech')
2. (Years > 2)
3. (Department == 'Sales')
4. (Salary < 70000)

. . .

*Answer: (1 OR 3) AND 2 AND 4*

---

## Practice 5: Choose the Right Transformation
<p class="subheader">Why transform data?</p>

**Scenario:** Comparing test scores across different schools where class sizes vary dramatically (10-50 students)

You have:

- Total_Points_Earned (all students combined)
- Number_of_Students

. . .

Which transformation makes schools comparable?

a) Total_Points_Earned + Number_of_Students
b) Total_Points_Earned - Number_of_Students
c) Total_Points_Earned / Number_of_Students
d) Total_Points_Earned * Number_of_Students

. . .

**Answer: c) Creates average score per student**

---

## Practice 6: Predict Grouping Output
<p class="subheader">What will the grouped data look like?</p>

| Order_ID | Customer | Amount | Region |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| O001 | Alice | 50 | East |
| O002 | Bob | 30 | West |
| O003 | Alice | 70 | East |
| O004 | Charlie | 40 | East |
| O005 | Bob | 60 | West |

We've `Grouped by Customer` then `Summed by Amount`.

. . .

How many rows in output? _____

. . .

What's the sum for Bob? _____

. . .

Which customer has highest total? _____

. . .

*Answers: 3 rows, 90, Alice (120)*

## Tips for Part 2
<p class="subheader">Key concepts to remember</p>

<br>

**Filtering:**

- AND: both conditions must be true
- OR: at least one condition must be true

. . .

**Grouping:**

- Output has one row per group
- Choose the right aggregation (sum, mean, count, etc.)

---

## Tips for Part 2
<p class="subheader">Key concepts to remember</p>

<br>

**Transformations:**

- Division normalizes for fair comparison
- Log transformation helps with different scales

. . .

**Data Cleaning:**

- Text → Number needs type conversion
- Missing values: drop or fill (not both!)
- Consistent format before analysis
