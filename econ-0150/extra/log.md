so I think I want to record exercises like I did homework, with a direct to camera with a laptop, then have the screen recording to the side. eventually I want a concept video also rerecord, and have the Livestream recorded too, added as a separate card, with the script including discussion questions 

I also think the motivation isn't quite right yet. I think it's close. I want to start with a dataset that we want to learn something from, then walk through how we might answer the question from the data, which requires some skills.

I think I'm going to make another change:

Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

I want four different distributions with the same summary stats but very different histograms like anscomb for Part 1.2.

1. Cross Sectional Data: Categorical Data (Bar); Numerical Data (Histogram; Boxplot)
2. Timeseries Data (Line; Boxplot)
3. Panel Data: Long (MultiLine; MultiBoxplot); Wide (Scatterplot)
4. Bivariate (Boxplot; Scatterplot) with Anscomb
5. Geographic (Map; Chloropleth)

Part 2: Data Operations

1. Clean
2. Transform
3. Filter
4. Group
5. Reshape
6. Merge

- prepare the survey in slides and talk it through at the start of day 2. this way it's visually interesting, doesn't get caught up with notebooks before covering them, and shows not tells why summarization is powerful
- I'm thinking about putting data structures with variable types and then do classification by type, structure, and n, then maybe move time series into part 1 and numerical by category into part 2
- I want a better way to ask questions during exercises, like here's a nice figure, but find this specific number. less do what I just did, and more use the tool I just showed to answer this new question
- ok so part 1.0 will be EDA framework on day 2, in class looking at and working with the survey, leaving some questions for the homework
- then for next time i'm going to do
  1. part 1.1 crosssection categorical and bar (next time)
  2. part 1.2 crosssection numerical and hist and boxplot (next time)
  3. part 1.3 timeseries numerical and line and boxplot
  4. part 1.4 numerical by category (crosssection: box and strip and timeseries: multiline) maybe part 2?

Changes:

- Part 1.0: merge survey results with part 1.0 Variable Types and part 1.3 Data Structures and separate out the homework question variables so i don't cover them in class. then maybe even add in a time series plot showing excitement for the class over time. this is also where i have students get familiar with excel and python and datasets
- relabel Part 1.1 as Part 1.1: Crosssectional Categorical Variables (no changes)
- relabel Part 1.2 as Part 1.2: Crosssectional Numerical Variables (no changes)
- Part 1.3 is Timeseries Numerical, drawing on what's currently in Part 2.2, leaving the rest for Part 2 to talk about relationships between variables through time
- I'm realizing theres actually a lot of panel data in here. the multi-period boxplot is panel. and Timeseries Numerical by Category is also panel. 
- Part 1.4 is Transformations, where we start with a CPI adjustment, then do the global hours example
- 
- Part 2.0 is Framework and anscombe's
- Part 2.1 is Crosssectional Numerical by Numerical (scatterplot, current 2.1)
- Part 2.2 is Crossectional Numerical by Category (stripplot by category, new)
- Part 2.3 is Timeseries Numerical by Category (current 1.4)
- Part 2.4 is Timeseries Numerical by Numerical (oil prices and coffee prices example, maybe add this at the end of 2.1)
- Part 2.5 is Panel with Multi-Box and Scatter (current coffee consumption 2.1 example, maybe just keep this in 2.1)
- Part 2.6 is Geographic Data

Students had a lot of trouble getting set up with colab. Most of it was just using basic syntax with strings and file systems and such. I think it would be helpful to do demos with code to fall back on, but creating the notebook from scratch. 

I also want to use data from econ papers when we start building models. I think that would be SOOO cool.

I also don't think the intro sequence is in the right order. I feel I'm losing students interests early on by spending too much time on the simple stuff before getting into the cool stuff. Maybe there's a way to really lock students in with an example. I like the survey idea. But it's not really coming through at the moment. 

I think it also might be good to post a python demo and have students come to the second class having gone through it. 

Maybe it would be best to start with data structures, then talk about data types. So it would be, here's cross-section, time series, and panel. Then we're going to focus on cross section in the survey. Talk about the different types of variables. 

Maybe it would make sense to call the exercises "startup exercises". I'm trying to organize the startup in a way to justifies the exercises as distinct from the examples. 

Maybe Part 1.0 is about organizing data into structures and types. Then call the exercises "examples". Then we go into more detail about thinking about categorical variables in Part 1.1 and so on.

Then I'll call Part 0 the survey demo that we'll do on day one. This demo would include discussion of data types and structures, univariate data, multivariate data, a t-test, a regression, and a fixed effect. 

Then Day Two would start on Part 1.0 with the exercises.
