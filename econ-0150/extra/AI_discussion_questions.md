## AI Discussion Framework

### Opening Binary Questions (for hand-raising)

1. "Have you used AI tools besides our classroom Python exercises?" (Yes/No)
2. "Do you find AI helpful in your homework?"
3. "Do you think you've learned more because you've had access to AI?"
4. "Do you feel more optimistic than anxious about AI's role in your future career?" (Optimistic/Anxious)
5. "Has AI already changed how you approach learning or problem-solving?" (Yes/No)
6. "Do you think AI will create more jobs than it eliminates in economics?" (More/Fewer)
7. "Would you be comfortable having your own economic research analyzed or evaluated by AI?" (Yes/No)
8. "Have you ever been convinced by content that you later discovered was AI-generated?" (Yes/No)
9. "Do you ever feel pressure to use AI when you'd rather work through a problem yourself?" (Yes/No)

### Bridge Questions (slightly more nuanced but still relatively quick)

1. "On a scale of 1-5, how much do you trust AI outputs in economics research?" (Show fingers 1-5)
2. "Where do you see AI being most valuable in economics: data cleaning, analysis, visualization, or communication?" (Hand raise for each)
3. "If you had to choose, would you rather have AI handle routine tasks while you focus on creative work, or have AI generate creative ideas while you handle implementation?" (First option/Second option)

### Open-ended Discussion Questions

1. "What economic questions do you think AI should never answer without human oversight?"
2. "How has working with AI for Python changed your approach to problem-solving or learning?"
3. "What specific AI skill or capability would be most valuable for your career interests?"
4. "What's one misconception about AI you think is common among your peers?"
5. "How might the economics field change in response to widespread AI adoption?"

### Closing Reflection

1. Do you think it's a good idea to be integrating AI into society?
2. "What's one boundary you personally plan to set in your use of AI tools as you continue your studies?"



This structure moves from simple binary responses that can help students see where they stand relative to peers, toward more reflective discussions that can reveal nuanced perspectives. The questions touch on personal experiences, career implications, ethical considerations, and practical applications without leading students toward overly positive or negative viewpoints.
