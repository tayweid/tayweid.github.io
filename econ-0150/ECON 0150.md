## ECON 0150

- Move measures of centrality and dispersion to part 1 or part 2 next time

- finish reviewing part 3 for next semester

- hey you've seen my slides and notes so far. i'm working on writing out the notes and exercise for 3.1. could you look at these slides and this outline of notes for the slides and try to write it out more fully, including the exercise 3.1?

- setup the framework at the beginning with the survey, then remind of what's been added to it each topic 

- next sem i want them to end each part with a data project of their own data

- add population distribution vs sampling distribution to slides

#### Keep Notes

part 1.0 is just thinking about the types of variables, no visualizations. remove visualizations from the slides to stay on point. use different examples in the slides so that student's can't use them to guess variable types in exercises. exercises are simply downloading and opening up the datasets in excel and python, becoming familiar with datasets, and how to read them.

part 1.1 

\- do an exercise with binary categorical data (employed / not) with a pie and a bar

\- do an exercise with nominal categorical data (coffee shops by state) with a pie and a bar, showing a pie doesn't work well

\- do an exercise with ordinal categorical data (economic optimism) with an unordered bar, showing it needs order

\- add some guidelines at the end for what makes a good visualization

\- talk about tables vs figures

\- conclusions: use pie charts only for binary, use bar charts for nominal, ordered bar charts for ordinal, remove clutter, put information near objects

part 1.2 

\- keep the example the same, pretty good

part 1.3 is just thinking about different data structures. maybe do cross section and time series but definitely not panel. 

\- do an exercise using transactions by time of day to show time series

part 1.4 is the same, building on part 1.3

\- do an exercise in both python and excel

part 1.5 is good

\- do an exercise in both python and excel

part 1.6 is good

\- do an exercise in both python and excel

part 1.7 needs to be simplified somehow. the example is too difficult.

part 2.1 start with anscobe to motivate using visuals then do the sequence on good multivariate visuals

\- do an exercise using anscobe quartet, both excel and python

\- then do the rest of the slides with exercises

\- i think part 2.1 and 2.2 could be organized better. there's a lot of overlap: much of part 2.1 is actually about time

\- i think part 2.1 focusses on scatterplots, so the first part of 2.1, then jump ahead to using it to look at two periods in time

part 2.2 does more with timeseries, line graphs, then boxplots at the end

\- do exercises in python and excel

part 2.3 is mapping. i like the current examples but the exercise should use the pa income by county dataset

I want to get students thinking about datasets they may want to work with very early in the semester 

maybe I could use the TA to give feedback on their ideas

maybe a project where I have them try to misreport a result, like try to get a positive result where one does not exist 

mediation analysis, residual plot, added variable plot, conditioning

PART 6

#### Notes

- Should do more transformations: per capita, nominal - real, log, moving averages, seasonal adjustment. Examples in Parman.
- https://thedoublethink.com/tuftes-principles-for-visualizing-quantitative-information/ tufts principles
- Next time I want to do descriptive statistics in EDA
- Maybe talk about ethics in the hypothesis testing section, and motivate it with having them do some bad hypothesis testing
- EVERY WEEK IN FIRST CLASS: Ask students a question / problem we haven't yet covered in class but with resources on the website, and they turn in their answer. Then we spend the week covering something similar / same content in class with more background and more examples. Maybe even use the example on the quiz.

## Calendar

Three Exams on Thursdays, one is dropped, 30 mins

Seven homework, two before each exam, one before the final.

A group case study during finals.

Three parts:

Part 1: Core statistics concepts: probability, random variables, normal distribution, sampling, plus causal relationships. This part starts with a refresh of core statistics concepts and implements them using data in Excel. Then we build models of relationships between variables and talk about the arrow of causality. Then measuring the core concepts of central tendency and variance in data and using english to communicate what each idea means.

Part 2: Interpreting data with code. This part introduces code, working with data in code, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, running regression, multivariate regression, seasonality, dummies, fixed effects, etc. Then take code to data to interpret the dataset and use English to communicate what the data means and what it doesn’t.

Part 3: Communicating with data. This is the part where we start building tables and figures and embedding them in slides. 

Homework will be skill based. So they will get a dataset and have to do something with it. MiniExams will be concept based and done in class on paper. There will be one final project where they will have to apply their skills creatively to a case study and communicate their findings in slides.

Katerine also mentioned introducing students to more economics-focussed ideas, not just the data analysis type skills

Part 1: Core statistics concepts, correlations, causal relationships. This part starts with a refresh of core statistics concepts and implements them using data in Excel. Then we build models of relationships between variables and talk about the arrow of causality.

### July 16, 2024

The primary goal of the class is to equip students with the ability to interpret and communicate with data. This starts with applying statistics concepts to data, developing a skillset with code and spreadsheets, and then communicating with figures and tables.

The first part of the class will focus on statistics, with extra credit for doing a Brilliant or Coursera course on stats. The idea is to get students familiar with basic statistical tools before using them. Once we get the prereq, this will become more straightforward. Right now, the idea is to offload some of the familiarization to a great online program so the class can move forward with the core of the course. The second part will focus on working with data in Excel and python. I want students to be familiar with using Excel, but they need to know how to use python. It’s the main tool the field is moving to. It’s a slightly different way of thinking which is different from Excel and is useful no matter the language. It’s not possible to match every student to the software they will use in the future. Instead, I want students to have skills with the two major formats: spreadsheets and code. The third part of the course will focus on data analytics directly, understanding and communicating with data. This will involve 

Assessments will be in-class MiniExams and homework. Homework will vary in structure. Some will be skills based, so “what is the median height in the sample", or “summarize this data”, some will be project-based, so “write some code” or “use a figure to communicate this data”.

Also having not taught this course previously, I want to have regular meetings (every other week) with Buke as I deviate from her script. I want to talk about what’s working in her class, what I’m doing in the pilot class, and some ways to sharpen the redesign.

### June 26

I talked with Kojo yesterday who was a Data Analyst for Smucker. He said older people use excel to communicate, but the more savvy people use Python and R. Maybe what I’ll try to do is give students the tools to use excel but then do most work in python or R.

### June 25

I’m thinking Buke and I will meet once or twice this summer, then she will run her own course in the fall, then meet regularly throughout the semester. This will let me get a sense of what she’s doing and try to offer some extra support for moving in the direction the department wishes. 

I haven’t yet found a textbook i’m in love with. The closest I’ve found is **An Introduction to Data Analysis** by Tiffany Bergin.

I did find that Brilliant.org has a course on Data Analytics and Statistics, which looks very good, and could be used as extra credit.
