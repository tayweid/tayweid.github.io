## Concept 1.0 | Variable Types

We cannot typically understand our data without summarizing it. We do this with tables and figures. There are many summary tools. Some more useful than others. Some are useful for some situations but not in others. The main differentiators between a good and bad summarization tools is the shape of the data and what you're trying to understand about the data. 

There are generally three dimensions of data: Variable Type, Data Structure, and Number of Variables. We'll return to Data Structures next week. And later we'll talk about multivariate data. To start, we'll try to classify Variable Types

There are two main variable types, each with subtypes: Categorical Variables and Numerical Variables.
