#### Economic Data Analysis | Week 3 + MiniExam Schedule

Hi folks,

Congrats on making it through the first two weeks of the semester. It's been a real pleasure getting to know you so far. We've already made some real progress in this class. We've focussed on Crosssectional Data so far, data that has been collected at one point in time from many units. We've classified the variables as either Categorical or Numerical; we've developed best practices for visualizing each variable type; and we've started working with data in software. But often the insight in our data isn't easy to see through the lens of Crosssectional visualizations. Where we're turning to next is one of those data structures: Timeseries.

I've gone ahead and scheduled our first **MiniExam: Tuesday September 23**. This will give us the time to finish Part 1. I'll post plenty of information ahead of each MiniExam for you to feel prepared for each one, including a MiniExam Demo walking you through problems similar to what you can expect on each upcoming MiniExam. 

We have Homework 1.3 and 1.4 due this week, which I'll post before class tomorrow. These should not take more than half an hour or so.

Anyway, looking forward to seeing you tomorrow!

#### Economic Data Analysis | Week 4

Hi folks!

I hope your weekend was lovely! We're back at it this week, finishing up Part 1 before MiniExam 1 next week. 

Last class we introduced Panel Data, data with both a cross-sectional and timeseries dimension. We looked at transactions by coffee shop, using a Multi-Linegraph to find which shift was the busiest. Then we ended by using Multi-Boxplots to examine how coffee consumption patterns have changed through time for many coffee importing countries. On the way out the door I asked you to find how many countries increased their coffee consumption during the 20 years we had data for. You told me that Boxplots could not answer this question and I told you that we have a tool that can.

This week we're introducing the Scatterplot! We'll start by using the Scatterplot for panel data, wrapping up Part 1.4. Then we'll explore the scatterplot in more detail with Bivariate Data in Part 1.5. If we have time we'll close out Part 1 with Geographic Data.

This is a big week: Scatterplot is an S-Tier tool.

See you tomorrow!

#### Economic Data Analysis | Week 5 and MiniExam 1

Hi folks,

Congrats on making it through Part 1! We've covered how to explore and summarize data appropriately. We started the semester with exploratory data analysis with nice and well organized datasets. Everything I've given you so far has been in the right format to easily summarize. But sometimes we don't get datasets that are nicely set up for our question at hand. 

On Tuesday (tomorrow) after MiniExam 1 we start Part 2, where we begin developing basic skills of data operations. We'll begin with cleaning data, then talk about grouping, transforming, reshaping, and merging. These skills will set up all the foundational skills to use data to develop statistical models starting in Part 3.

MiniExam 1 will take place during the first 20 minutes of class on Tuesday (tomorrow). As I mentioned in class, the MiniExam 1 Demo is posted at the bottom of the Part 1 page. If you feel good about the Demo, the Homework, and the Exercises we've done in class, you're going to be in good shape going into the MiniExam. And don't hesitate to reach out before the next MiniExam if you feel like you'd want more resources next time.



See you tomorrow,

Taylor



#### Economic Data Analysis | Week 6

Hi folks,

Congrats on making it through MiniExam 1! We started the semester getting familiar with data and developing a systematic method for understanding what it contains. We started Part 2 by recognizing that not every dataset is nice enough to apply exploratory data analysis to on it's own, so we developed our first type of Data Operation in Part 2.1: Data Cleaning. This week we're doing more interesting work, continuing Part 2.2: Transforming Data, and Part 2.3: Filtering Data, allowing us to ask questions of subgroups within our data.

As always, you'll have homework for both parts, due on Friday at 5 with a no questions asked extension if you email me.

By the end of Part 2 you'll have a full set of data skills in hand before we start building the foundations of the statistical models we use in the field in Part 3.

See you tomorrow!

#### Economic Data Analysis | Week 7 + MiniExam 2

Hi folks,

I hope your weekend was lovely and full of sunshine. This week we're rounding out the rest of the basic skillset for working with data. What if we want to compare average costs by employee or total ridership by bus route? On Tuesday we'll talk about tools and approaches for **Grouping**. Then on Thursday we'll close out Part 2 with our last data operation: **Merging Datasets**. 

MiniExam 2 will take place during the first 20 minutes of class on Tuesday October 14, a week from tomorrow, and will cover everything in Part 2.

Next week we will have covered the core skillsets for working with data. We are now on the doorstep to begin working with the core ideas to start building real statistical models. These are the big ideas that allow us to generate new knowlege from data, some of the biggest ideas we have in science. Get hyped.



Warmly,

Taylor



#### Economic Data Analysis: Week 8 + MiniExam 2

Hi folks,

Welcome to Week 8. This is a big one. On Tuesday we're taking MiniExam 2. Then we start building statistical models of data. You've seen some of the core ideas in your stats class: Random Variables, Probability Distributions, Sampling, Central Limit Theory, and Confidence Intervals. These form the foundation of a more powerful framework we call the General Linear Model. Many of you have seen some of the pieces, but very few of you will have seen the model in its whole. This is the workhorse model we use in early every area of empirical science. We'll start tomorrow.

Get some good sleep tonight. See you in class.



Warmly,

Taylor
