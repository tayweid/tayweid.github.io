#### Economic Data Analysis | Week 3 + MiniExam Schedule

Hi folks,

Congrats on making it through the first two weeks of the semester. It's been a real pleasure getting to know you so far. We've already made some real progress in this class. We've focussed on Crosssectional Data so far, data that has been collected at one point in time from many units. We've classified the variables as either Categorical or Numerical; we've developed best practices for visualizing each variable type; and we've started working with data in software. But often the insight in our data isn't easy to see through the lens of Crosssectional visualizations. Where we're turning to next is one of those data structures: Timeseries.

I've gone ahead and scheduled our first **MiniExam: Tuesday September 23**. This will give us the time to finish Part 1. I'll post plenty of information ahead of each MiniExam for you to feel prepared for each one, including a MiniExam Demo walking you through problems similar to what you can expect on each upcoming MiniExam. 

We have Homework 1.3 and 1.4 due this week, which I'll post before class tomorrow. These should not take more than half an hour or so.

Anyway, looking forward to seeing you tomorrow!

Taylor
