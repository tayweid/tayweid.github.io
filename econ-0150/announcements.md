#### Economic Data Analysis | Week 3 + MiniExam Schedule

Hi folks,

Congrats on making it through the first two weeks of the semester. It's been a real pleasure getting to know you so far. We've already made some real progress in this class. We've focussed on Crosssectional Data so far, data that has been collected at one point in time from many units. We've classified the variables as either Categorical or Numerical; we've developed best practices for visualizing each variable type; and we've started working with data in software. But often the insight in our data isn't easy to see through the lens of Crosssectional visualizations. Where we're turning to next is one of those data structures: Timeseries.

I've gone ahead and scheduled our first **MiniExam: Tuesday September 23**. This will give us the time to finish Part 1. I'll post plenty of information ahead of each MiniExam for you to feel prepared for each one, including a MiniExam Demo walking you through problems similar to what you can expect on each upcoming MiniExam. 

We have Homework 1.3 and 1.4 due this week, which I'll post before class tomorrow. These should not take more than half an hour or so.

Anyway, looking forward to seeing you tomorrow!

#### Economic Data Analysis | Week 4

Hi folks!

I hope your weekend was lovely! We're back at it this week, finishing up Part 1 before MiniExam 1 next week. 

Last class we introduced Panel Data, data with both a cross-sectional and timeseries dimension. We looked at transactions by coffee shop, using a Multi-Linegraph to find which shift was the busiest. Then we ended by using Multi-Boxplots to examine how coffee consumption patterns have changed through time for many coffee importing countries. On the way out the door I asked you to find how many countries increased their coffee consumption during the 20 years we had data for. You told me that Boxplots could not answer this question and I told you that we have a tool that can.

This week we're introducing the Scatterplot! We'll start by using the Scatterplot for panel data, wrapping up Part 1.4. Then we'll explore the scatterplot in more detail with Bivariate Data in Part 1.5. If we have time we'll close out Part 1 with Geographic Data.

This is a big week: Scatterplot is an S-Tier tool.

See you tomorrow!

#### Economic Data Analysis | Week 5 and MiniExam 1

Hi folks,

Congrats on making it through Part 1! We've covered how to explore and summarize data appropriately. We started the semester with exploratory data analysis with nice and well organized datasets. Everything I've given you so far has been in the right format to easily summarize. But sometimes we don't get datasets that are nicely set up for our question at hand. 

On Tuesday (tomorrow) after MiniExam 1 we start Part 2, where we begin developing basic skills of data operations. We'll begin with cleaning data, then talk about grouping, transforming, reshaping, and merging. These skills will set up all the foundational skills to use data to develop statistical models starting in Part 3.

MiniExam 1 will take place during the first 20 minutes of class on Tuesday (tomorrow). As I mentioned in class, the MiniExam 1 Demo is posted at the bottom of the Part 1 page. If you feel good about the Demo, the Homework, and the Exercises we've done in class, you're going to be in good shape going into the MiniExam. And don't hesitate to reach out before the next MiniExam if you feel like you'd want more resources next time.



See you tomorrow,

Taylor
