| 13 | **4.3** | Interactions | Different slopes by group |
| 13-14 | **4.4** | Numerical Controls | Multiple predictors, "holding constant" |
| | | **MiniExam 4** | |
| 14 | **5.1** | Analysis Workflow | Question → data → model → interpretation |
| 15 | **5.2** | Presenting Findings | Slides, narrative, examples |
| Finals | | **Final Project Presentations** | |

## Comparison: When Key Skills Arrive

|-------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| First histogram | 2 | 2 | Same |
| First bar chart | 2 | 5 | 3 weeks later (but with analytical motivation) |
| First confidence interval | 8-9 | 3-4 | **4-5 weeks earlier** |
| First hypothesis test | 9 | 3-4 | **5 weeks earlier** |
| First model (Simplest GLM) | 9-10 | 4 | **5-6 weeks earlier** |
| Grouped boxplots | 6 | 5-6 | Same |
| First regression | 10 | 7-8 | **2-3 weeks earlier** |
| Scatterplots | 6 | 7-8 | 1-2 weeks later |
| Line plots / time series | 3 | 10 | 7 weeks later |
| Panel data (melt/pivot) | 4-5 | 11 | 6 weeks later |
| Conditional relationships | 7 | 12 | 5 weeks later (but now with tools to address it) |
| Multivariate regression | 12-13 | 12-13 | Same |
| Project could start after | ~Week 8 | ~Week 8 | Same |
