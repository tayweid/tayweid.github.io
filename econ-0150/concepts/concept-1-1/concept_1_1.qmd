### *Part 1.1 | Summarizing Categorical Variables*

## Summarizing Categorical Variables
<p class="subheader">... use the appropriate summary tool for the variable type</p>

---

## Catagorical Variables: Visualizations
<p class="subheader">Q. Which state has the second most locations?</p>

![](i/i_01.png)

*> pay attention to which of these two figures is easier to answer the question*

---

## Catagorical Variables: Bar Plots
<p class="subheader">Q. Which state has the second most locations?</p>

![](i/i_02.png)

*> make the bar graph even easier to read by placing the number near the bar*

---

## Catagorical Variables: Remove Clutter
<p class="subheader">Q. Which state has the second most locations?</p>

*> removing clutter also guides your eye to the important information*

## Catagorical Variables: Order by Size
<p class="subheader">Q. Which state has the second most locations?</p>

![](i/i_05.png)

*> states have no inherent order, but sorting can make comparisons easier*

---

## Example: Coffee Shops by State
<p class="subheader">Q. How does CA compare to the whole?</p>

![](i/i_03.png)

. . .

*> instead of a nominal categorical variable, this is a binary categorical variable (CA / Other)*

---

## Example: Coffee Shops by State
<p class="subheader">Q. How does CA compare to the whole?</p>

![](i/i_07.png)

. . .

*> this question is much easier to see when visualizing as a binary categorical variable*

---

## Example: Coffee Shops by State
<p class="subheader">Q. How does CA compare to the whole?</p>

![](i/i_08.png)

. . .

*> here both the pie and the bar communicte the data effectively*

---

## Example: Coffee Shops by State
<p class="subheader">Q. How does CA compare to the whole?</p>

![](i/i_09.png)

*> but if the question is about shares of a whole, precentages with a pie chart may work best*

## Takeaways
<p class="subheader">... use the right summary tool for the variable type</p>

::: {.incremental}
- Binary Categorical Variables: use a **pie chart** or **bar graph**
- Nominal (unordered) Categorical Variables: use a **bar graph**; maybe order by value
- Ordinal Categorical Variables: use an **ordered bar graph**
- Remove clutter; keep it simple
- Place information near their object

## Exercise 1.1 | Categorical Variables

<br><br>

Lets visualize the data in each dataset.

- **Dataset 1:** `employment_status.csv`
- **Dataset 2:** `household_savings.csv`
- **Dataset 3:** `household_incomes.csv`

## Exercise: Dataset 1
<p class="subheader">Summarize `employment_status.csv`.</p>

. . .

## Exercise: Dataset 2
<p class="subheader">Summarize `household_savings.csv`.</p>

. . .

## Exercise: Dataset 3
<p class="subheader">Summarize `household_incomes.csv`.</p>
