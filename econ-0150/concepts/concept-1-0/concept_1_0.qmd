### *Part 1.0 | Variable Types*

---

## Dimensions of Data
<p class="subheader">Data comes in all shapes, sizes, and types.</p>

#### Variable Type
- Categorical data
- Numerical data

#### Data Structure
- Cross-sectional data
- Time series data
- Panel data

#### Number of Variables
- Univariate (n=1)
- Bivariate (n=2)
- Multivariate (n>2)

## Variable Types: Categorical
<p class="subheader">... data that's best recorded in categories</p>

**Binary**: only two categories

- Economics major (YES/NO)
- Human (YES/NO)

**Nominal**: categories cannot be ordered / ranked

- Blood types (A, B, AB, 0)
- Colors (Red, Blue, Green)

**Ordinal**: categories have order / rank but not a meaningful scale

- Education levels (High School, Bachelor's, Master's, PhD)
- Survey responses (Strongly Disagree, Neutral, Agree, Strongly Agree)
- Size categories (Small, Medium, Large)

---

## Variable Types: Numerical
<p class="subheader">... data that's best recorded in numerical form</p>

**Discrete**: countable numbers with meaningful intervals\

- Number of children in a household (1, 2, ... )
- Number of siblings (1, 2, ... )

**Continuous**: quantities measurable on the reals

- Household income
- US GDP

## Exercise 1.0 | Variable Types

<br><br>

Lets identify the variable type for each dataset.

- **Dataset 1:** `unemployment_status.csv`
- **Dataset 2:** `employment_sector.csv`
- **Dataset 3:** `economic_optimism.csv`
- **Dataset 4:** `household_size.csv`
- **Dataset 5:** `household_income.csv`
