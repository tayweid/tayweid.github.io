## Part 1.3 | Data Structures
<p class="subheader">...three main relationships between data points.</p>

The way we understand data depends on the relationship between the data points.

| | Cross-Sectional | Time-Series | Panel Data |
|-|----|---|----|
| **Focus** | Multiple units, one time point | One unit, many times | Multiple units, many time points |
| **Shape** | Wide format | Long format | Long format |
| **Ex.** | Household income, 2025 | US GDP,   10 years | Household income, 10 years |

## Exercise 1.3 | Data Structures

<br><br>

Lets identify the data structure for each dataset.

- **Dataset 1:** `us_real_gdp.csv`
- **Dataset 2:** `household_savings.csv`
- **Dataset 3:** `household_incomes.csv`

---

## Exercise: Dataset 1
<p class="subheader">`us_real_gdp.csv` is a Time-Series Dataset</p>

. . .

**Clue**: Each year's GDP (the unit of observation) is connected through time.

## Exercise: Dataset 1
<p class="subheader">`us_real_gdp.csv` is a Time-Series Dataset</p>

**Clue**: Each year's GDP (the unit of observation) is connected through time.

## Exercise: Dataset 2
<p class="subheader">`household_savings.csv` is a Cross-Sectional Dataset</p>

. . .

**Clue**: Each household (the unit of observation) appears only once.

## Exercise: Dataset 3
<p class="subheader">`household_incomes.csv` is a Panel Dataset</p>

. . .

**Clue**: Each household (the unit of observation) has many appearances. 

---

## Exercise: Dataset 3
<p class="subheader">`household_incomes.csv` is a Panel Dataset</p>

**Clue**: Each household (the unit of observation) has many appearances.

*> this is too noisy to communicate well*

---

## Exercise: Dataset 3
<p class="subheader">`household_incomes.csv` is a Panel Dataset</p>

**Clue**: Each household (the unit of observation) has many appearances. 

![](i/i_07.png)

*> this is a little better*

---

## Exercise: Dataset 3
<p class="subheader">`household_incomes.csv` is a Panel Dataset</p>

**Clue**: Each household (the unit of observation) has many appearances. 

![](i/i_08.png)

Focus on the variation *among the households* within the year using a ***boxplot***.
