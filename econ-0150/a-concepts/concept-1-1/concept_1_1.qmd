### *Part 1.1 | Summarizing Categorical Variables*

---

- talk about tables vs figures

---

## Summarizing Categorical Variables
<p class="subheader">... use the appropriate summary tool for the variable type</p>

---

## Example: Coffee Shops by State
<p class="subheader">Q. Which state has the second most locations?</p>

![](i/i_01.png)

*> pay attention to which of these two figures is easier to answer the question*

---

## Example: Coffee Shops by State
<p class="subheader">Q. Which state has the second most locations?</p>

![](i/i_02.png)

*> we could make the bar graph even easier to read by placing the number near the bar*

*> removing clutter also guides your eye to the important information*

*> states have no inherent order, but sorting can make it easier to make comparisons*

---

## Example: Coffee Shops by State
<p class="subheader">Q. How does CA compare to the whole?</p>

![](i/i_03.png)

. . .

*> instead of a nominal categorical variable, this is a binary categorical variable (CA / Other)*

---

## Example: Coffee Shops by State
<p class="subheader">Q. How does CA compare to the whole?</p>

![](i/i_07.png)

. . .

*> this question is much easier to see when visualizing as a binary categorical variable*

---

## Example: Coffee Shops by State
<p class="subheader">Q. How does CA compare to the whole?</p>

![](i/i_08.png)

. . .

*> here both the pie and the bar communicte the data effectively*

---

## Example: Coffee Shops by State
<p class="subheader">Q. How does CA compare to the whole?</p>

![](i/i_09.png)

*> but if the question is about shares of a whole, precentages with a pie chart may work best*

---

## Takeaways
<p class="subheader">... use the right summary tool for the variable type</p>

. . .

- Binary Categorical Variables: use a **pie chart** or **bar graph**

. . .

- Nominal (unordered) Categorical Variables: use a **bar graph**; maybe order by value

. . .

- Ordinal Categorical Variables: use an **ordered bar graph**

. . .

- Remove clutter; keep it simple

. . .

- Place information near their object

## Exercise
<p class="subheader">Summarize `economic_optimism.csv`.</p>

![](i/Part_1_1_Ordinal_Categorical_Exercise.png)

- do an exercise with ordinal categorical data (economic optimism) with an unordered bar, showing it needs order
