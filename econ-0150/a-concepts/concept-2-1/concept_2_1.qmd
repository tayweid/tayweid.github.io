## Summary

<br><br>

::: {.incremental}
- Relationships between two variables can be easily summarized in scatterplots.
- Scatterplots make it easy to visually filter either axis.
- Scatterplots make it easy to compare absolute differences by axis.
- A log-scale transformation makes it easy to compare ratios.
- A log-log-scale makes it easy to see variation in both large and small values.

## Exercise: Scatterplots
<p class="subheader">Visualizing GDP and Coffee Production Relationships</p>

We’re going to use a scatterplot to visually examine the relationship between coffee production and GDP.
