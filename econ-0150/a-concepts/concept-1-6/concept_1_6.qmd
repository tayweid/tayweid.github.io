### *Part 1.6 | Grouping Data*

---

## Example 1.6 | Starbucks Offers
<p class="subheader-center">In starbucks_promotions.csv, which offers are most effective?</p>

. . .

<br>

```{.python code-line-numbers="2|5"}
# Import packages
import pandas as pd

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv("starbucks_offers.csv")
```

## Starbucks Offers | The Original Table
<p class="subheader-center">Which offers are most effective?</p>

We have a table of events ...

<br><br><br>

<div class='fragment'>
*>not straightforward to see which offers are most effective*
</div>

---

## Starbucks Offers | Grouping and Summing
<p class="subheader-center">Which offers are most effective?</p>

We could start by summarizing total revenue by `Offer ID`.

<div class='fragment'>
1. Filter (if needed; keep all rows for now)
</div>
<div class='fragment'>
```{.python code-line-numbers="2"}
# Filter (no filter here yet)
#data = data[filter]
```
</div>

<br>

<div class='fragment'>
2. Group by `Offer ID`
</div>

<div class='fragment'>
```{.python code-line-numbers="2"}
# Group by ID
grouped_by_id = data.groupby("Offer ID")
```
</div>

<br>

<div class='fragment'>
3. Sum revenue by group
</div>

<div class='fragment'>
```{.python code-line-numbers="2"}
# Sum revenue by group
grouped_revenue = grouped_by_id["Revenue"].sum()
```
</div>

::: notes
Notice we now get a table with 5 rows (one for each offer).
This helps us see total revenue per offer, but not average revenue yet.

## Starbucks Offers | Grouping
<p class="subheader-center">Which offers are most effective?</p>

We can group on any cateogrical variable, like `Event`:

<div class='fragment'>
```{.python code-line-numbers="2"}
# Summarize total revenue by 'Event'
event_summary = data.groupby("Event")["Revenue"].sum()
```
</div>

<div class='fragment'>
![](../Examples/Part_1_6/i/2.png)
</div>

<div class='fragment'>
*> "Offer" has 0 revenue, so youâ€™ll see zeros for those rows*
</div>

---

## Starbucks Offers | Use Grouping to Count
<p class="subheader-center">But how many offers are there per group?</p>

<div class='fragment'>
We can also use groups to count how many rows there are for each event type:

```{.python code-line-numbers="2"}
# Count number of each event
event_count = data.groupby("Event")["Event"].count()
```
</div>

<div class='fragment'>
![](../Examples/Part_1_6/i/3.png)
</div>

. . .

*> lets use counting approach to help us determine effectiveness*

## Starbucks Offers | Filtering + Grouping
<p class="subheader-center">What is the average transaction amount per offer type?</p>

Lets account for these zero revenue events by filtering for transactions.

<div class='fragment'>
1. Filter `Event == "transaction"` (exclude zero-revenue "Offer" rows)
```{.python}
# Filter for transactions only
transactions_only = data[data["Event"] == "transaction"]
```
</div>

<br>

<div class='fragment'>
2. Group by Offer ID
</div>

<div class='fragment'>
```{.python}
# Group by Offer ID
transaction_groups = transactions_only.groupby("Offer ID")
```
</div>

<br>

<div class='fragment'>
3. Take the mean of the revenue column
```{.python}
# Take the mean revenue
mean_revenue = transaction_groups["Revenue"].mean()
```
</div>

---

## Starbucks Offers | Filtering + Grouping
<p class="subheader-center">What is the average transaction amount per offer type?</p>

![](../Examples/Part_1_6/i/4.png)

<div class='fragment'>
*> this often gives a better picture of how much people spend per transaction when they use the offer*
</div>

. . .

*> but we might also want to account for how many times the offer was sent out in the first place*

## Starbucks Offers | Drawing Conclusions
<p class="subheader-center">Which offers are truly most effective?</p>

1. How many times was each offer type sent?

. . .

```{.python}
# Count offers by Offer ID
offers_count = data.groupby("Offer ID")["Event"].count()
```

. . .

![](../Examples/Part_1_6/i/4_1.png)

## Starbucks Offers | Drawing Conclusions
<p class="subheader-center">Which offers are truly most effective?</p>

2. How many times was each offer actually used?

. . .

```{.python}
# Count transactions by Offer ID
transactions_only = data[data["Event"] == "transaction"] # Filter for Transaction
transactions_count = transactions_only.groupby("Offer ID")["Event"].count()
```

. . .

![](../Examples/Part_1_6/i/4_2.png)

3. Revenue by group.

. . .

```{.python}
# Sum revenue by Offer ID
grouped_revenue = data.groupby("Offer ID")["Revenue"].sum()
```

. . .

## Starbucks Offers | Combining Results
<p class="subheader-center">Which offers are truly most effective?</p>

<div class='fragment'>
*> lets find the value for each offer type*
</div>

<div class='fragment'>
Combine `offers_count`, `transactions_count`, and `grouped_revenue` into a single data frame.
</div>

<div class='fragment'>
```{.python}
summary = pd.DataFrame({
    "Offers": offers_count,
    "Transactions": transactions_count,
    "Revenue": grouped_revenue
})
```
</div>

<div class='fragment'>
Use this combined dataframe to construct new columns.
</div>

<div class='fragment'>
```{.python}
# Create a "Revenue per Offer" column
summary["Revenue_per_Offer"] = summary["Revenue"] / summary["Offers"]

# Create a "Transactions per Offer" column
summary["Transactions_per_Offer"] = summary["Transactions"] / summary["Offers"]
```
</div>

## Starbucks Offers | Interpretation
<p class="subheader-center">Which offers are most effective?</p>

<br><br>

1. The offer 5off20 has the highest **revenue** but a lower **redemption rate**.
2. The offer 3off7 has a high **redemption rate** but the discount may be costly to Starbucks.
3. The offer 2off10 lands solidly in the top on both metrics and represents a more modest discount.

## Part 1.6 | Summary

<br><br>

::: {.incremental}
- **Group and Aggregate**: Group by relevant columns to quickly summarize data <br>
- **Filtering Matters**: Filter out irrelevant rows before grouping
- **Common Aggregations**: Use summaries like **sum**, **count**, **mean**, or **max**
- **Widespread Use**: This technique is core to data analysis in nearly every field
- **Next Steps**: Combine grouping and filtering with joins, pivots, or merges for even richer analysis and visualization.
