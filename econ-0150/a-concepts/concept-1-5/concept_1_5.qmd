## Part 1.5 | Filtering Data by Inequality
<p class="subheader">Filtering continuous data requires using inequalities.</p>

| Symbol | Python | | Example |
|--------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| = | == | | `df[df['age'] == 25]` |
| ≠ | != | | `df[df['age'] != 25]` |
| < | < | | `df[df['age'] < 25]` |
| > | > | | `df[df['age'] > 25]` |
| ≤ | <= | | `df[df['age'] <= 25]` |
| ≥ | >= | | `df[df['age'] >= 25]` |
