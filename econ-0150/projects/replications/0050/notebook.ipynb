    "**Research Question:** How Do Changes in In-State Tuition Affect Changes in Undergraduate Enrollment, and Does This Relationship Differ Between Public and Private Institutions?\n",

    "**Data Source:** IPEDS data on tuition and enrollment for 2016 and 2023 (2,025 institutions)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods:** OLS regression with arcsinh transformation and interaction term (tuition x institution type)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Finding:** The tuition-enrollment relationship differs by institution type: private institutions show a small positive association (coef = 0.04, p = 0.22), while public institutions show a negative differential effect (interaction = -0.12, p = 0.09).\n",

    "- Arcsinh transformations (handling negative values)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regression Results:**\n",
    "- **Arcsinh tuition change coefficient:** ~0.04 (p = 0.22)\n",
    "- **Public indicator:** ~-0.74 (p = 0.17)\n",
    "- **Interaction (tuition x public):** ~-0.12 (p = 0.09)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **For private institutions**: The baseline effect of tuition changes on enrollment changes is small and not statistically significant (coef = 0.04, p = 0.22).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **For public institutions**: The negative interaction term (-0.12) suggests that public institutions may experience a different (more negative) relationship between tuition increases and enrollment changes, though this is only marginally significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Practical significance**: The R-squared is low (0.015), indicating that tuition changes explain only a small portion of enrollment changes. Many other factors (demographics, program quality, job market conditions) also affect enrollment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Arcsinh Transformation?\n",
    "\n",
    "The arcsinh (inverse hyperbolic sine) transformation is used because:\n",
    "- Some institutions had enrollment *decreases* (negative values)\n",
    "- Log transformation doesn't work for negative or zero values\n",
    "- Arcsinh(x) ≈ log(2x) for large positive x, so it behaves similarly to log for positive values"
