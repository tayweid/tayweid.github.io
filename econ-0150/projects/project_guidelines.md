## ECON 0150 | Spring 2026 | Final Project

### Guidelines

The final project is your place to demostrate your ability to analyze and communicate data, using at least one skill / concept from each of the six parts. You will select a dataset, conduct a comprehensive analysis, and present your findings through both a slide presentation and a written report. I'll select some projects to be displayed on the course website after the semester has finished and used as references for future classes.

The most challenging steps in the final project are typically 1) finding a question that's answerable with data, and 2) finding a dataset that on the vast internet. I've provided some example projects from past semesters and a list of good economic data sources (e.g., FRED, World Bank, BLS, Election Data Source, etc.). You're more than welcome to 1) use data from one of the provided replications or databases, or 2) find or collect your own dataset related to an economic question of interest to you. If you choose to use a dataset from a previous semesters' group, you need to demonstrate that you and not the previous group can analyze and communicate data.

The project will build progressively over the semester. At the end of each Part, you will submit a part project demostrating your ability to apply the concepts in that Part to a dataset of your choosing. You are encouraged to work in a group and to pick a topic that could turn into your final project. But you are more than welcome to switch groups or topics at any point. 

Make this your own and have fun with it! There are general guidelines, but don't let the guildelines stop you from doing what interests you. Lets just have a quick chat about it.

#### Timeline

**Part 1 Project**

- Diagram a dataset and summarize a single variable in a dataset of your choosing.

**Part 2 Project**

- Visualize a relationship between variables in a dataset of your choosing using a Part 2 tool

**Later**

- *Part 3 Project*
- *Part 4 Project*
- *Part 5 Project*
- *Project groups of 2-3: select and submit to your group and a general question of interest to you.*

- *Project proposal: Select a topic/question, a descriptive figure, and a statistical model.*

- *Draft analysis: Send me a draft of your writeup and slides, including at least one figure,.*

- *Final presentation: Present 1-2 slides, described below.*

- *Written report and replication folder, described below.*

#### Written Report (1-2 pages)

Submit a short report (roughly 2 pages) and a folder with all your data and replication code. Your report will include the following:

1. Introduction and question

   *Successful introductions quickly introduce a question that is both answerable with data and has is economics question. Focus on something that you are interested in and keep the question small enough that it is something you can answer. You do not need to ask a world-changing question at this stage in your career.*

2. Data description and sources 

   *Include summary statistics and data visualizations of your main variables and relationships. Mention where your data comes from, any issues with reliability and source credibility. Describe any data cleaning or prepration needed for your analysis.*

3. Methodology

   *Describe your GLM, what each part of the model is doing, and it's limitations. This should not be long, potentially as short as a single paragraph.*

4. Results and analysis

   *Report a summary of your model's results. Interpret the important parts of your results in words. Assess the validity of the model using a residual plot. Mention any limitations of your model.*

5. Conclusions

   *Like your introduction, tell your readers what you did, what you found, and how it answers your question. Make it easy for your reader to understand the connection between your analysis and your question.*

6. References

   *Include references to your data sources and any relevant literature. There is no length or format requirement. The references section is a place to allow those reading your work to be able to replicate it.*

#### Presentation (1-2 slides)

Summarize your research in 1-2 clear, concise slides highlighting:

- Research question
- Key findings
- Most compelling visualization
- Main conclusions

Be prepared for a 3-minute presentation.
