## ECON 0150 | Final Project

### Guidelines

The final project is your place to demostrate your ability to analyze and communicate data. You will select a dataset, conduct a comprehensive analysis, and present your findings through both a slide presentation and a written report. I'll select some projects to be displayed on the course website after the semester has finished and used as references for future classes.

The most challenging steps in the final project are typically 1) finding a question that's answerable with data, and 2) finding a dataset that on the vast internet. I've provided some example projects from past semesters and a list of good economic data sources (e.g., FRED, World Bank, BLS, Election Data Source, etc.). You're more than welcome to 1) use data from one of the provided databases, or 2) find or collect your own dataset related to an economic question of interest to you. 

Make this your own and have fun with it! There are general guidelines, but don't let the guildelines stop you from doing what interests you. Lets just have a quick chat about it.

#### Timeline

**Friday, November 7 (in Homework)**

- *Project groups of 2-3: select and submit to your group and a general question of interest to you.*

**Tuesday, November 18**

- *Project proposal: Select a topic/question, a descriptive figure, and a statistical model.*

**Friday, December 5 (on Gradescope)** 

- *Draft analysis: Send me a draft of your writeup and slides, including at least one figure,.*

**Finals Period** (1PM Section: *Friday, December 12, at 12PM* | 2:30 PM Section: *Monday, December 8 at 12PM*)

- *Final presentation: Present 1-2 slides, described below.*

**Friday, December 12, 5PM**

- *Written report and replication folder, described below.*

#### Written Report (1-2 pages)

Submit a short report (roughly 2 pages) and a folder with all your data and replication code. Your report  will include the following:

1. Introduction and question

   *Successful introductions quickly introduce a question that is both answerable with data and has is economics question. Focus on something that you are interested in and keep the question small enough that it is something you can answer. You do not need to ask a world-changing question at this stage in your career.*

2. Data description and sources 

   *Include summary statistics and data visualizations of your main variables and relationships. Mention where your data comes from, any issues with reliability and source credibility. Describe any data cleaning or prepration needed for your analysis.*

3. Methodology

   *Describe your GLM, what each part of the model is doing, and it's limitations. This should not be long, potentially as short as a single paragraph.*

4. Results and analysis

   *Report a summary of your model's results. Interpret the important parts of your results in words. Assess the validity of the model using a residual plot. Mention any limitations of your model.*

5. Conclusions

   *Like your introduction, tell your readers what you did, what you found, and how it answers your question. Make it easy for your reader to understand the connection between your analysis and your question.*

6. References

   *Include references to your data sources and any relevant literature. There is no length or format requirement. The references section is a place to allow those reading your work to be able to replicate it.*

#### Presentation (1-2 slides)

Summarize your research in 1-2 clear, concise slides highlighting:

- Research question
- Key findings
- Most compelling visualization
- Main conclusions

Be prepared for a 3-minute presentation.
