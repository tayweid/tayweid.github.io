# ECON 0150 Assessment Redesign Notes

## The Problem

Students can reliably produce correct visualizations — identify variable types, choose appropriate charts, execute them cleanly. This is good, but it means the current exam acts as a floor, not a ceiling. Everyone clusters together because the task doesn't reach the level where real analytical differences show up.

## The Exam Shift

Move from "here's a dataset, visualize it" to "here's a dataset with multiple variables, and here's a question someone wants answered." Students must now decide which variables matter, what relationships to explore, what the visualization reveals, and what it doesn't. The technical production is still there, but it's in service of analytical judgment — the part that distinguishes someone who can follow steps from someone who thinks like an analyst.

This also makes explanation natural rather than forced. "Explain why you chose a bar chart" is tedious. "Explain what you found and why it matters" is the actual work of data analysis.

## Specs Grading Structure

Following Nilson's framework, the course assessment can use a two-tier, pass/not-yet structure:

- **Standard tier:** Produce a correct, readable visualization for a given dataset. This establishes competency — right variable classification, appropriate chart type, clean execution, basic interpretation. Most students already meet this bar.
- **Advanced tier:** Given a dataset and an open-ended analytical question, choose what to visualize, produce it, and write an interpretation of what the data shows and what remains uncertain. This is where meaningful separation happens.

Letter grades map to bundle completion: A requires passing advanced-tier work across the course's core competency areas, B requires standard-tier completion across all areas, and so on. Everyone *can* earn an A, but the A reflects genuine analytical thinking.

## Transition Plan

No need to rebuild from scratch. Tag current assignments by competency area, use end-of-semester student work to identify where the natural bundles are, and write specs over the summer using the "what would make me hand this back" test. Pilot the redesigned exam structure first — it's the highest-leverage change.
