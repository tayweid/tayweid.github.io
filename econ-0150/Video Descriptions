This clip is taken from a livestream of my Econ 0150 class at the University of Pittsburgh during the Fall 2025 semester. This course introduces the basic ideas and skills in exploratory data analysis and visualization, statistical thinking, building general linear models (regression), and communicating with data. This course is designed as a student's first exposure to working with data and building statistical models with a statistics prerequisite.  
The course organized in six Parts. 
- Part 1: Exploratory data analysis 
- Part 2: Data operations 
- Part 3: Core statistical ideas 
- Part 4: Basic general linear model (regression)
