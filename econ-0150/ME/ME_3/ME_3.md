## ECON 0150 | MiniExam 3 | Fall 2025

This MiniExam will take 16 minutes with a quick break to follow. MiniExams are designed to both test your knowledge and challenge you to apply familiar concepts in new environments. Treat it as if you're trying to show me that you understand the material. Answer clearly, completely, and concisely.

#### Academic Conduct Code

The following academic conduct code is designed to protect the integrity of your work. Print your name/initials beside the three academic honesty agreements. I pledge to my fellow students, the university, and the instructor, that:

________ I will complete this MiniExam solely using my own work.
________ I will not use any digital resources unless explicitly allowed by the instructor.
________ I will not communicate directly or indirectly with others during the MiniExam.







###### Q1. A class's average sleep time follows an *exponential* distribution with mean (μ) of 8 hours and standard deviation (σ) of 1.5 hours.

**a)** If you sample one student ($n=1$), what is the sampling distribution of the sample mean?

Shape: ______________

Mean: ______________

Standard error: ______________

**b)** If you sample 36 students ($n=36$), what is the sampling distribution of the sample mean?

Shape: ______________

Mean: ______________

Standard error: ______________

**c)** If you sample one student ($n=100$), what is the sampling distribution of the sample mean?

Shape: ______________

Mean: ______________

Standard error: ______________

###### Q2. You take 1000 samples ($n=64$) of classes, each with sleep times following an *exponential* distribution with mean (μ) of 8 hours and standard deviation (σ) of 1.5 hours (*same as in Q1*).

**a)** If you were to plot a histogram of the sample means student's sleep times, describe the distribution you would expect to see:

Shape: ______________

Mean: ______________

Standard error: ______________

**b)** According to the Central Limit Theorem, which statement is correct?

□ The sample mean will equal the population mean when n is large enough

□ The individual data points in a sample will follow a normal distribution 

□ The distribution of sample means will approach a normal distribution

□ The population distribution must be normal for the theorem to apply

###### Q3. You are interested in whether students sleep on average 8 hours per night. You take one sample of 100 students ($n=100$) with an average sleep time ($\bar{x}$) of 7.5 hours and standard deviation ($S$) of $1$. You have decided in advance to reject the null hypothesis if it lies 3 standard errors away from the sample mean.

**a)** Describe the sampling distribution. 

Shape: ______________

Mean: ______________

Standard error: ______________

**b)** Construct the confidence interval for your test.

Lower Bound: __________________________________________                                    Upper Bound: __________________________________________

**c)** Use a figure of the probability density function of the sampling distribution to show the confidence interval for your test.





**d)** Using this confidence interval, are you able to reject the null hypothesis?        YES / NO

###### Q4. A researcher conducts a test of whether students sleep on average 7.8 hours per night with a p-value of 0.12. Describe in one sentence what this p-value means.
