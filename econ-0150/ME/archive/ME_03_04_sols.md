## ECON 0150 | MiniExam 03 | Spring 2025 - Answer Key

###### Q1. 
**a)** The scatter plot shows a positive relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy, with the relationship appearing to level off at higher GDP levels.

**b)** A logarithmic transformation should be applied to GDP per capita because this would help linearize the relationship by reducing the impact of extreme values and accounting for the diminishing returns in life expectancy at higher GDP levels.

###### Q2. 
A multi-line plot with three different colored lines would effectively show the simultaneous patterns, allowing direct comparison of seasonal fluctuations, trends, and stability across regions over time.

###### Q3. 
**a)** Calculate the distance between each census tract centroid and its nearest Lake Michigan point, then create a scatter plot with distance-to-lake on the x-axis and number of parks per tract on the y-axis.

**b)** A stacked bar chart with distance bins on the x-axis and bars showing the count of each park type would show how park types are distributed across different distances from the lake.

**c)** A strong negative relationship (downward slope) in the scatter plot would indicate that tracts closer to the lake tend to have more parks.

###### Q4. 
**a)** A scatter plot would be most appropriate to examine the relationship between marketing spend and revenue as it allows us to visualize the correlation between these two continuous variables.

**b)** [Sketch should show points roughly following a positive linear trend]

**c)** There appears to be a strong positive linear relationship between marketing spend and revenue, suggesting that higher marketing spending is associated with higher revenue.

###### Q5. 
**a)** A scatter plot would be most appropriate to visualize the relationship between city size and temperature while showing the distribution of all data points.

**b)** The population variable should be log-transformed because the large range in city sizes (from 50,000 to 15 million) would make the relationship difficult to visualize on a linear scale.

###### Q6. 
A choropleth map with a time slider would be ideal for this dataset, allowing viewers to see geographic patterns while also tracking changes over time. The map could use color intensity to show adoption rates, with the ability to play through years to show the progression of internet adoption across regions, while maintaining the geographic context that's crucial for regional comparison.

#### Grading Rubric
- Each question part is worth equal points
- Answers should demonstrate:
  - Clear understanding of visualization principles
  - Appropriate choice of visualization for the data type
  - Logical reasoning for transformations
  - Ability to interpret patterns and relationships
- Partial credit given for:
  - Correct visualization choice but incomplete explanation
  - Partial understanding of relationships
  - Reasonable alternative approaches with good justification
