##### Q1. Trace the Filter Operation (see Table 1)

Given the bookstore sales data, which rows remain after applying:
**Filter: (Price < 30) OR (Category == 'Fiction')**

Circle the Book_IDs that would remain in the filtered dataset:

**[B001]    [B002]    [B003]    [B004]    [B005]    [B006]**



##### Q2. Multi-Step Data Operation (see Table 2)

Fill in the exact result of the following operations using the restaurant ratings data:
1. Filter for Rating >= 4
2. Group by Cuisine
3. Count rows in each group

| Cuisine | Count |
|---------|-------|
| _______ | _____ |
| _______ | _____ |
| _______ | _____ |

##### Q4. Understanding Transformations (see Table 4)

The delivery company wants to compare driver efficiency across regions with different wage levels. They have: `Deliveries_per_hour`, `Local_minimum_wage`. Circle the best transformation and explain why in ONE sentence:

**a)** Deliveries_per_hour + Local_minimum_wage  
**b)** Deliveries_per_hour - Local_minimum_wage  
**c)** Deliveries_per_hour / Local_minimum_wage  
**d)** Deliveries_per_hour * Local_minimum_wage  



##### Q5. Predict the Grouping Output (see Table 5)

After grouping the employee data by Department and calculating MEDIAN Salary:

**How many rows will the output have?** ________________________________________

**What will be the median salary for Sales?**
[52,000]  [55,000]  [58,000]  [60,000]

**Which aggregation would give Sales the HIGHEST value?**
[mean]  [median]  [min]  [max]  [sum]
