Understanding Panel Data in wide format using Multi-Boxplots ( Concept 1.4 pt.2 // ECON 0150 )

ECON 0150 - Economic Data Analysis | Part 1.4 | Panel Data

Concept 1.4 pt.2 (in-class): 
[ ] Data on coffee consumption per capita through time
[ ] Histograms are difficult to compare

[ ] Understanding sequences of change through time
[ ] Last question: how have specific countries changed through time?

This clip is taken from a livestream of my Econ 0150 class at the University of Pittsburgh during the Fall 2025 semester. This course introduces the basic ideas and skills in exploratory data analysis and visualization, statistical thinking, building general linear models (regression), and communicating with data. This course is designed as a student's first exposure to working with data and building statistical models with a statistics prerequisite.  
The course organized in six Parts. 
- Part 1: Exploratory data analysis 
- Part 2: Data operations 
- Part 3: Core statistical ideas 
- Part 4: Basic general linear model (regression) 
- Part 5: Intermediate general linear model 
- Part 6: Communicating with data 

Each Part contains multiple Sub-Parts. In each Sub-Part: 
- Concepts introduce new ideas 
- Exercises practice new ideas in class 
- Homework practices ideas outside of class 
MiniExams test mastery on paper in class at the end of each Part.
