    <!-- DESCRIPTION -->

            <p>
                Part A begins with a big question. What should we choose when we can't have everything? Even the richest people in the world can't have everything they might want. Wants exceed our resources. So how should we as individuals and groups go about making choices? 
            </p>
            <p>
                It turns out that when we view any choice as costing us the value of our next best option, relying on others can be good for everyone simultaneously. To show this we build a model of opportunity cost, the production possibility fronteir, and comparative advantage, asking: Where on the PPF should we live?
            </p>
            <p>
                This question is where economic thinking began and makes up many of the puzzles at the heart of how we organize society. And it's exactly where we're headed in this course.

                The place to start is with <a href="Textbook/Chapters_1_2_3.pdf" target="_blank">Chapters 1, 2, and 3</a>. This might sound heretical, but I recommend <i>not</i> reading in detail on your first time through the text. Use your first read to develop an understanding of the scope of what's being discussed. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                Then once you've finished reading, take a look at the practice material, and use the text as a resource when you need help. This way, you know what's most important, get to practicing quickly, and know where to find help when you innevitably get stuck.

                MiniExam A will be held on Tuesday September 6th and covers everything included in Part A. Do your best to not feel nervous. You will begin to learn that if you're able to do the work in the Homework and Homework Demo, understand the concepts, and can solve the MiniExam Demo, you're going to be in good shape.

                This is a resource for you to use as you'd like. But here's my advice. Start by trying to solve MiniExam A Demo on your own. Then once you've worked through everything as best you're able, use the video to check your work. You're more than welcome to watch this video first, but you're not going to catch your weak points as easily, which is the main point.

                Here’s your weekly roundup of quality questions (anonymized and summarized) asked by your colleges. If you see your question here, take it as a compliment from me. :)
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Q. </b>I noticed that we could use any material from our notes and textbook, and we may not use anything that requires internet access. I'm sure others have been in a similar situation, but my notes and textbook are digital. Would it be acceptable to place my device in airplane mode during the mini exams?
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>A. </b>In the past I’ve asked for devices to be put on airplane mode. But sometimes there aren’t options for storing notes locally, so we can work around it. The main thing is that I need to know when and if there are exceptions to the no-internet rule. So if you need a to use an internet connected device, its your responsibility to let me know ahead of time.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <b>Q. </b>You mentioned in Lecture 1 that one can find the slope of the PPF. This is true because the frontier is linear, but what if the points make the shape of a curve? Would we then take the derivative? 
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>A. </b>Yes. If the PPF isn’t linear then we can’t just easily use the slope to find the opportunity cost. But one could take a derivative to find the opportunity cost at a particular point. If its not linear, then the slope would then be varying. But! You won’t need to do that in this class.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <b>Q. </b>How come the slope of the PPF is the negative of the opportunity cost of spinach? Why couldn't it be positive since the opportunity cost is positive after all? I do realize that the curve wouldn't concave down, hence it not being at PPF.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>A. </b>Right, when we think about costs (like the cost of a coffee), we give it a positive number (like $3.00). This is all we’re doing with opportunity cost. The slope of the PPF is negative since it reflects the trade off between the two goods. There isn’t anything deep there, its really just a mathematical thing. You could say buying a coffee gives you -$3.00 and it might be confusing but I’d know what you mean. The same applies here.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Q. </b>The PPF shifts in a diagonal sort of way (y-intercept (0, 8) and x-intercept (45, 0) because the new technology was introduced only to increase the carrot production, correct? If there was technology to increase the spinach production, then the PPF would shift out more or less evenly. However, I would imagine the curve not being completely straight (linear) if the two different technologies increased the amount of each crop at a different rate. I wouldn't be certain on how to approach that instance. Ultimately, I want to make sure that the units of spinach also increase when the technology for carrots is used.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>A. </b>It’s right that the pivot shift of the PPF was just because the technology impacted one of the two crops. If, however, we introduced a second new technology improving spinach, we would still see a linear PPF, just with another pivot out on the other axis. The idea would be the same as with the carrot pivot, just doing it a second time for spinach. If the technology shift’s the PPF linearly, no matter how many technologies are introduced the PPF will always be linear. :)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <b>Q. </b>Is the difference between a production function and a production possibilities frontier curve that the production function does not account for the decreasing productivity given increased time? Now that I think about it, I think I'm confusing different concepts...
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>A. </b>You’re right! The shape of the PPF comes from the production functions as you saw in the four quadrant PPF videos. They are two separate but stacked concepts.
